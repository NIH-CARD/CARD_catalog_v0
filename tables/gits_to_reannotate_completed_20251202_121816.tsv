Genetic/genomic data (genotyping data), clinical data from GP2 and AMP-PD databases, population genetics data (EAS population mentioned), individual-level patient and control data, covariate data for genetic association studies.	Python, Jupyter notebooks, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Terra platform, bioinformatics libraries for genetic analysis, tools for principal component analysis (PCA), GWAS analysis tools, and data visualization packages.
Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project	ADSP	Alzheimer's Disease	https://github.com/mvisionai/AdSpike	mvisionai	mvisionai	Python	"YES - This repository is clearly biomedically relevant as it focuses on Alzheimer's Disease (AD) research, as evidenced by the ""AdSpike"" name, AD-specific dataset imports, and neuroimaging preprocessing pipelines for brain analysis."	This code implements a neuroimaging analysis pipeline for Alzheimer's Disease research, combining spiking neural networks (via BindsNET) with brain image preprocessing. The system includes MRI data preprocessing using FSL registration tools and appears to apply spiking neural network models to analyze neuroimaging data for AD classification or analysis.

Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project	ADSP	Alzheimer's Disease	https://github.com/NIAGADS/ADSPIntegratedPhenotypes	NIAGADS	heatherissen	R	YES - This repository is clearly biomedically relevant as it deals with ADSP (Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project) data, focusing on harmonized phenotypes for Alzheimer's disease research. It specifically works with WGS (Whole Genome Sequencing) data and phenotype analysis related to neurodegenerative disease research.	This R script is designed to process ADSP (Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project) data by filtering whole genome sequencing samples to include only genetically unique samples from the WGS 36k dataset. The script outputs a file containing harmonized phenotype data for each selected sample, using the most current list of released ADSP WGS files.	Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) data, phenotype data, genetic data from ADSP project	R programming language
