Multi-ancestry genome-wide meta-analysis of 56,241 individuals identifies known and novel cross-population and ancestry-specific associations as novel risk loci for Alzheimer's disease.	BACKGROUND: Limited ancestral diversity has impaired our ability to detect risk variants more prevalent in ancestry groups of predominantly non-European ancestral background in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). We construct and analyze a multi-ancestry GWAS dataset in the Alzheimer's Disease Genetics Consortium (ADGC) to test for novel shared and population-specific late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) susceptibility loci and evaluate underlying genetic architecture in 37,382 non-Hispanic White (NHW), 6728 African American, 8899 Hispanic (HIS), and 3232 East Asian individuals, performing within ancestry fixed-effects meta-analysis followed by a cross-ancestry random-effects meta-analysis. RESULTS: We identify 13 loci with cross-population associations including known loci at/near CR1, BIN1, TREM2, CD2AP, PTK2B, CLU, SHARPIN, MS4A6A, PICALM, ABCA7, APOE, and two novel loci not previously reported at 11p12 (LRRC4C) and 12q24.13 (LHX5-AS1). We additionally identify three population-specific loci with genome-wide significance at/near PTPRK and GRB14 in HIS and KIAA0825 in NHW. Pathway analysis implicates multiple amyloid regulation pathways and the classical complement pathway. Genes at/near our novel loci have known roles in neuronal development (LRRC4C, LHX5-AS1, and PTPRK) and insulin receptor activity regulation (GRB14). CONCLUSIONS: Using cross-population GWAS meta-analyses, we identify novel LOAD susceptibility loci in/near LRRC4C and LHX5-AS1, both with known roles in neuronal development, as well as several novel population-unique loci. Reflecting the power of diverse ancestry in GWAS, we detect the SHARPIN locus with only 13.7% of the sample size of the NHW GWAS study (n = 409,589) in which this locus was first observed. Continued expansion into larger multi-ancestry studies will provide even more power for further elucidating the genomics of late-onset Alzheimer's disease.

Postmortem tau in the CA2 region of the hippocampus in older adult men who participated in youth amateur American-style football.	BackgroundResearchers have reported that hyperphosphorylated tau (p-tau) accumulates in the Cornu Ammonis 2 subfield (CA2) of the hippocampus with age, preferentially in primary age-related tau astrogliopathy, in association with early Alzheimer's disease, and preferentially in chronic traumatic encephalopathy neuropathologic change.ObjectiveExamine the possible association between preferential p-tau in the CA2 region of the hippocampus and history of playing high school American-style football.MethodsPostmortem brain tissue samples were obtained from the Lieber Institute for Brain Development for 174 men (median age at death = 65 years; range = 50-96). There were 126 with no known history of participation in contact or collision sports and 48 (27.6%) who participated in football.ResultsApproximately half were rated modified Braak stage I (47.1%) and modified CERAD stage 0 (52.0%). Preferential CA2 p-tau was present in 29.9%. The average age for those with versus without preferential CA2 p-tau was 75 and 63, respectively (Cohen's d = -1.27, large effect).The sport history groups did not differ in age (p = 0.607). In both univariate and multivariate logistic regressions, older age groups (odds ratio [OR] = 3.42 and 3.23) and those with greater modified CERAD scores (OR = 1.78 and 1.48) were significantly more likely to have preferential CA2 p-tau. There was not a significant association between football participation and preferential CA2 p-tau.ConclusionsThere was not a significant association between participation in high school football and preferential CA2 p-tau identified after death. These results support other theories in the literature-that preferential CA2 p-tau is associated with aging and with Alzheimer's disease neuropathologic change.

Amyloid-β predominant Alzheimer's disease neuropathologic change.	Different subsets of Alzheimer's disease neuropathologic change (ADNC), including the intriguing set of individuals with severe/widespread amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques but no/mild tau tangles [Aβ-predominant (AP)-ADNC], may have distinct genetic and clinical features. Analysing National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center data, we stratified 1187 participants into AP-ADNC (n = 95), low Braak primary age-related tauopathy (PART; n = 185), typical-ADNC (n = 832) and high-Braak PART (n = 75). AP-ADNC differed in some clinical features and genetic polymorphisms in the APOE, SNX1, WNT3/MAPT and IGH genes. We conclude that AP-ADNC differs from classical ADNC with implications for in vivo studies.	ADGC; NACC; amyloid-β; biomarker; diffuse plaques

GWAS of multiple neuropathology endophenotypes identifies new risk loci and provides insights into the genetic risk of dementia.	Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified >80 Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD)-associated genetic loci. However, the clinical outcomes used in most previous studies belie the complex nature of underlying neuropathologies. Here we performed GWAS on 11 ADRD-related neuropathology endophenotypes with participants drawn from the following three sources: the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center, the Religious Orders Study and Rush Memory and Aging Project, and the Adult Changes in Thought study (n = 7,804 total autopsied participants). We identified eight independent significantly associated loci, of which four were new (COL4A1, PIK3R5, LZTS1 and APOC2). Separately testing known ADRD loci, 19 loci were significantly associated with at least one neuropathology after false-discovery rate adjustment. Genetic colocalization analyses identified pleiotropic effects and quantitative trait loci. Methylation in the cerebral cortex at two sites near APOC2 was associated with cerebral amyloid angiopathy. Studies that include neuropathology endophenotypes are an important step in understanding the mechanisms underlying genetic ADRD risk.

Evidence for a novel neuronal mechanism driving Alzheimer's disease, upstream of amyloid.	This perspective offers an alternative to the amyloid hypothesis in the etiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We review evidence for a novel signaling mechanism based on a little-known peptide, T14. T14 could drive neurodegeneration as an aberrantly activated process of plasticity selective to interconnecting subcortical nuclei, the isodendritic core, where cell loss starts at the pre-symptomatic stages of the disease. Each of these cell groups has the capacity to form T14, which can stimulate production of p-Tau and β-amyloid, suggestive of an upstream driver of neurodegeneration. Moreover, results in an animal AD model show that antagonism of T14 with a cyclated variant, NBP14, prevents formation of β-amyloid, and restores cognitive function to that of wild-type counterparts. Any diagnostic and/or therapeutic strategy based on T14-NBP14 awaits validation in clinical trials. However, an understanding of this novel signaling system could bring much-needed fresh insights into the progression of cell loss underlying AD. HIGHLIGHTS: The possible primary mechanism of neurodegeneration upstream of amyloid. Primary involvement of selectively vulnerable subcortical nuclei, isodendritic core. Bioactive peptide T14 trophic in development but toxic in context of mature brain. Potential for early-stage biomarker to detect Alzheimer's disease. Effective therapeutic halting neurodegeneration, validated already in 5XFAD mice.	Alzheimer's disease; T14 peptide; biomarkers; isodendritic core neurons; therapy

Chronic traumatic encephalopathy neuropathologic change in former Australian rugby players.	AIMS: We applied the 2021 consensus criteria for both chronic traumatic encephalopathy neuropathological change and traumatic encephalopathy syndrome in a small case series of six former elite-level Australian rugby code players. METHODS: Neuropathological assessment of these cases was carried out at the Sydney and Victorian Brain Banks. Clinical data were collected via clinical interviews and health questionnaires completed by the participants and/or their next of kin, and neuropsychological testing was conducted with participants who were capable of completing this testing. RESULTS: All cases exhibited progressive cognitive impairment during life. Chronic traumatic encephalopathy neuropathological change was identified in four out of the six cases. However, coexisting neuropathologies were common, with limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy and ageing-related tau astrogliopathy seen in all cases, intermediate or high Alzheimer's disease neuropathological change seen in four cases and hippocampal sclerosis seen in two of the six cases. CONCLUSION: The presence of multiple neuropathologies in these cases complicates clinical diagnostic efforts for traumatic encephalopathy syndrome. It will be important for further clinicopathological studies on larger groups to report all neuropathological comorbidities found in cases diagnosed with either chronic traumatic encephalopathy neuropathological change and/or traumatic encephalopathy syndrome.	chronic traumatic encephalopathy; concussion; neuropathology; sports; traumatic brain injury

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia, characterized by early memory impairments and gradual worsening of daily functions. AD-related pathology, such as amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques, begins to accumulate many years before the onset of clinical symptoms. Predicting risk for AD via related pathology is critical as the preclinical stage could serve as a therapeutic time window, allowing for early management of the disease and reducing health and economic costs. Current methods for detecting AD pathology, however, are often expensive and invasive, limiting wide and easy access to a clinical setting. A non-invasive, cost-efficient platform, such as computerized cognitive tests, could be potentially useful to identify at-risk individuals as early as possible. In this study, we examined the diagnostic value of an episodic memory task, the mnemonic discrimination task (MDT), for predicting risk of cognitive impairment or Aβ burden. We constructed a random forest classification algorithm, utilizing MDT performance metrics and various neuropsychological test scores as input features, and assessed model performance using area under the curve (AUC). Models based on MDT performance metrics achieved classification results with an AUC of 0.83 for cognitive status and an AUC of 0.64 for Aβ status. Our findings suggest that mnemonic discrimination function may be a useful predictor of progression to prodromal AD or increased risk of Aβ load, which could be a cost-efficient, noninvasive cognitive testing solution for potentially wide-scale assessment of AD pathological and cognitive risk.

A Metalloproteinase Cocktail from the Venom of	A disintegrin and metalloproteinase (ADAM) family proteins are a major class of membrane-anchored multidomain proteinases that are responsible for the shedding of cell surface protein ectodomains, including amyloid precursor protein (APP). Human ADAM 9, 10, and 17 proteolyze APPs and produce non-amyloid-genic p3 peptides, instead of neurotoxic amyloid-β peptides (Aβs; Aβ40 and Aβ42), which form fibrils and accumulate in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). The ADAM family is closely related to snake venom metalloproteinases (SVMPs), which are derived from ancestral ADAMs but act as soluble proteinases. To test the therapeutic potential of SVMPs, we purified SVMPs from	Alzheimer’s disease; a disintegrin and metalloproteinase (ADAM); amyloid beta (Aβ); amyloid precursor protein (APP); snake venom metalloproteinase (SVMP); α-secretase

What tests and measures accurately diagnose persisting post-concussive symptoms in children, adolescents and adults following sport-related concussion? A systematic review.	OBJECTIVE: To determine what tests and measures accurately diagnose persisting post-concussive symptoms (PPCS) in children, adolescents and adults following sport-related concussion (SRC). DESIGN: A systematic literature review. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, CINAHL and SPORTDiscus through March 2022. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Original, empirical, peer-reviewed findings (cohort studies, case-control studies, cross-sectional studies and case series) published in English and focused on SRC. Studies needed to compare individuals with PPCS to a comparison group or their own baseline prior to concussion, on tests or measures potentially affected by concussion or associated with PPCS. RESULTS: Of 3298 records screened, 26 articles were included in the qualitative synthesis, including 1016 participants with concussion and 531 in comparison groups; 7 studies involved adults, 8 involved children and adolescents and 11 spanned both age groups. No studies focused on diagnostic accuracy. Studies were heterogeneous in participant characteristics, definitions of concussion and PPCS, timing of assessment and the tests and measures examined. Some studies found differences between individuals with PPCS and comparison groups or their own pre-injury assessments, but definitive conclusions were not possible because most studies had small convenience samples, cross-sectional designs and were rated high risk of bias. CONCLUSION: The diagnosis of PPCS continues to rely on symptom report, preferably using standardised symptom rating scales. The existing research does not indicate that any other specific tool or measure has satisfactory accuracy for clinical diagnosis. Future research drawing on prospective, longitudinal cohort studies could help inform clinical practice.	Brain Concussion; Diagnosis

The effect of APOE4 on Alzheimer's plasma biomarkers among Mexican Americans in the HABS-HD cohort.	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The relationship between APOE4 status and plasma biomarkers previously shown to be related to Alzheimer's risk have not been carefully examined among Mexican Americans. This research is needed to elucidate disparities within the Alzheimer's field by evaluating key genetic factors in an underrepresented population. The present study deepens our understanding of the interaction between biological and genetic factors for these populations with greater incidence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and helps address whether APOE4 confers similar risk of AD in Mexican Americans as previously reported in Non-Hispanic Whites. METHODS: Cross-sectional data consisting of 792 Mexican American and 785 Non-Hispanic White participants from the Health & Aging Brain Study - Health Disparities (HABS-HD) with available plasma biomarkers and APOE4 genotype profiles were included in the present study. Linear regression models were used to test our hypotheses. APOE4-Race/ethnicity interaction term tested whether the biomarker levels differed between ethnic groups. Analyses were adjusted for age, gender, and education. Further analyses explored whether biomarker levels differed by APOE4 carrier status within racial/ethnic groups. RESULTS: Among 1577 participants (59.5% women; mean age 66.4 ± 8.74 years), significant differences were observed across race/ethnic and APOE4 groups. Mexican Americans were younger (p < 0.001), had a higher proportion of women (p = 0.001), fewer years of education (p < 0.001), and lower MMSE scores (p < 0.001). Biomarker differences between Mexican Americans and Non-Hispanic Whites included variations in Aβ42/Aβ40 (p = 0.03) and p-tau181 (p < 0.001), but not in total tau, TNF-α, or NfL levels (all p > 0.12). Race/ethnicity-APOE4 interactions were significant for Aβ42/Αβ40, p-tau181, and total tau (all p < 0.05) but not for NfL or TNF-α. APOE4 associations with Aβ42/Aβ40 and p-tau181 were significant in NH White participants (all p < 0.001) but not among Mexican Americans. CONCLUSION: These findings will significantly contribute to understanding potential differences in the role of APOE4 and AD plasma biomarkers among Mexican Americans. This research has the potential to enhance preventive care and early diagnosis for populations with a higher incidence of AD.

Circadian rhythms are associated with higher amyloid-β and tau and poorer cognition in older adults.	Several studies implicate circadian rhythm disturbances in Alzheimer's disease. However, very little is known about how circadian rhythms are associated with Alzheimer's pathological biomarkers in older adults at early stages of the disease, and how these relationships map onto cognition. This cross-sectional study used 24-h accelerometry data to investigate the relationships between circadian rhythms, amyloid-β (Aβ), tau, and cognition in 68 older adults with objective early cognitive impairment. Participants wore GENEActiv accelerometers for ∼1 month (mean = 31.8 days). Circadian rhythms measures were quantified from accelerometer data and included acrotime (average time of day of peak activity) and intradaily variability (IV) (average circadian rhythm fragmentation within a day). Aβ was measured as a composite, and tau (	Alzheimer’s disease; accelerometry; circadian rhythms; cognition; pathology

A phase 2 randomized, placebo-controlled study on the efficacy and safety of AR1001, a phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor, in patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease.	BACKGROUND: AR1001 is a phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor that produces improved cognitive performance and reduces amyloid-β and phosphorylated tau burdens in preclinical models of Alzheimer's disease (AD). OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of AR1001 in participants with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD). DESIGN: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 2 trial conducted at 21 sites in the United States. PARTICIPANTS: Adults aged 55-80 years with mild-to-moderate dementia as determined by National Institutes of Aging-Alzheimer's Association (NIA-AA) stage 4 or 5 and Mini-mental State Exam (MMSE) score 16-26. INTERVENTION: Once daily oral administration of placebo, 10 mg AR1001, or 30 mg AR1001 for 26 weeks followed by 26 weeks optional extension. MEASUREMENTS: Co-primary efficacy endpoints were changes from baseline at Week 26 in Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog 13) and Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Clinical Global Impression of Change (ADCS-CGIC). Secondary endpoints included measures of cognition, daily living, and depression. Levels of plasma biomarkers pTau-181, pTau-217, Aβ42/40 ratio, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and neurofilament light chain (NfL) were also examined. RESULTS: A total of 210 participants were enrolled and 82% completed 26 weeks of treatment. AR1001 10 mg and 30 mg were well-tolerated with a similar safety profile compared to placebo. After 26 weeks, there were no differences in ADAS-Cog13, ADCS-CGIC, or in secondary efficacy endpoints between groups. Levels of plasma biomarkers pTau-181, pTau-217, and GFAP were improved in the 30 mg AR1001 group compared to placebo. CONCLUSION: AR1001 was safe and well tolerated. Although primary efficacy endpoints were not met after 26 weeks of treatment, participants receiving 30 mg AR1001 showed favorable changes in AD-related plasma biomarkers compared to placebo.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the predictive utility of baseline plasma biomarkers and neuropsychological measures in identifying cognitively unimpaired older adults at risk of cognitive and functional decline over five years. BACKGROUND: The clinical and biological heterogeneity observed in Alzheimer's disease (AD) complicates design of trials and the identification of appropriate participants. Identifying practical tools to define more homogenous subgroups could enhance clinical trial enrichment and improve early detection. METHODS: We analyzed data from the Anti-Amyloid Treatment in Asymptomatic Alzheimer's Disease (A4) trial and its companion Evaluation of Amyloid Risk and Neurodegeneration (LEARN) observational study. The sample included 866 cognitively unimpaired, amyloid-positive individuals from the A4 trial (comprising participants randomized to receive Solanezumab or placebo) and 343 cognitively unimpaired, amyloid-negative individuals from LEARN. Cognitive/functional decline was defined as an increase of ≥0.5 in Clinical Dementia Rating-Global Score (CDR-GS) during a 240-week period. Using multiple logistic regression models, we evaluated the predictive value of demographic variables, APOE4 status, amyloid PET SUVR, plasma P-tau217, and Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Preclinical Alzheimer's Cognitive Composite (ADCS-PACC) in three groups: A4-Solanezumab, A4-placebo and LEARN. In a sub-study including 656 participants with available data, we assessed the incremental value of additional plasma biomarkers (Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio, GFAP, and NfL). RESULTS: Both plasma P-tau217 and ADCS-PACC significantly improved predictive performance over a base model with demographics and APOE4. The full model combining all predictor variables yielded the highest AUCs across A4 Solanezumab (0.80 ± 0.06), A4 Placebo (0.80 ± 0.06), and LEARN (0.78 ± 0.08). Adding other plasma biomarkers yielded small but consistent improvements in AUC (1-3%). CONCLUSIONS: Plasma P-tau217 and ADCS-PACC, individually and in combination, improved prediction of cognitive/functional decline in asymptomatic older adults. Predictive models incorporating these scalable and non-invasive measures improved clinical trial enrichment and earlier identification of at-risk individuals preclinical AD.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this cross-sectional observational study, outpatients with AD who were referred to the Neuropsychiatry Clinic of the Eginition Hospital in Athens from January 2006 to December 2006 were consecutively enrolled. All the participants underwent a neuropsychological assessment. The serum concentrations of Apolipoprotein A1 (ApoA1), Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule 1 (VCAM- 1), Intercellular Adhesion Molecule 1 (ICAM-1), Lipoprotein-A (LpA), and C-Reactive Protein (CR-P) were determined. RESULTS: Fifty-six AD patients were enrolled. ApoA1 was correlated with Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and AD Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living (ADCS-ADL). Combined biomarkers were correlated with MMSE, Neuropsychiatry Inventory, Clinical Dementia Rating Scale, and ADCS-ADL. DISCUSSION: Our study highlights the association between serum biomarkers of vascular dysfunction- specifically ApoA1, VCAM-1, ICAM-1, LpA, and CRP-and the cognitive and behavioral features of Alzheimer's Disease. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that assessing vascular biomarkers may offer valuable insights into the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying cognitive and behavioral decline in AD.

Protocol for a Randomized Phase II/III Double-Blind Placebo-Controlled Trial to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of Extended-Release Metformin in Amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment: Metformin in Alzheimer Dementia Prevention (MAP).	BACKGROUND: Metformin has been suggested as a possible strategy for the prevention of Alzheimer disease (AD) and AD related dementias. An early phase II clinical trial of short acting metformin versus placebo showed preliminary evidence of efficacy and safety in slowing cognitive decline among persons with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) without diabetes. OBJECTIVE: To conduct a phase II/III randomized clinical of extended-release metformin versus placebo in participants with aMCI without diabetes. METHODS: Ratio of 1:1 randomized placebo-controlled trial of extended-release metformin in 326 persons with aMCI without diabetes, aged 55 to 90 years, lasting 18 months, with 4 visits every 6 months including baseline. The primary outcome is changes in total recall in the Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test. Secondary outcomes include (1) changes in global cognitive performance, measured with the Alzheimer Disease Cooperative Study Preclinical Alzheimer Cognitive Composite (ADCS-PACC); (2) changes in neurodegeneration, ascertained as cortical thickness in areas affected by AD on brain MRI; (3) changes in cerebrovascular disease, ascertained as white matter hyperintensities (WMH) volume on brain MRI; (4) changes in whole brain amyloid ß (Aß) SUVR and in incident amyloid positivity; (5) changes in tau SUVR in a composite brain region comprising medial and inferolateral temporal cortex; (6) changes in plasma AD biomarkers. CONCLUSION: Observational studies and pilot trials suggest that metformin may help prevent cognitive decline in neurodegenerative disorders. This clinical trial aims to assess metformin's potential in preventing cognitive decline in at-risk individuals and its impact on biomarkers indicative of disease modification.	clinical trial; metformin; mild cognitive impairment

Artificial intelligence-driven natural language processing for identifying linguistic patterns in Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment: A study of lexical, syntactic, and cohesive features of speech through picture description tasks.	BackgroundLanguage deficits often occur early in the neurodegenerative process, yet traditional methods frequently fail to detect subtle changes. Natural language processing (NLP) offers a novel approach to identifying linguistic patterns associated with cognitive impairment.ObjectiveWe aimed to analyze linguistic features that differentiate cognitively unimpaired (CU), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and Alzheimer's disease (AD) groups.MethodsData was extracted from picture description tasks performed by 336 participants in the DementiaBank datasets. 53 linguistic features aggregated into 4 categories: lexical, structural, syntactic, and discourse domains, were identified using NLP toolkits. With normal diagnostic cutoffs, cognitive function was evaluated with the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA).ResultsWith age and education as covariates, ANOVA and post-hoc Tukey's HSD tests revealed that linguistic features such as pronoun usage, syntactic complexity, and lexical sophistication showed significant differences between CU, MCI, and AD groups (p < 0.05). Notably, past tense and personal references were higher in AD than both CU and MCI (p < 0.001), while pronoun usage differed between AD and CU (p < 0.0001). Correlations indicated that higher pronoun rates and lower syntactic complexity were associated with lower MMSE scores and although some features like conjunctions and determiners approached significance, they lacked consistent differentiation.ConclusionsWith the growing adoption of artificial intelligence (AI)-based scribing, these results emphasize the potential of targeted linguistic analysis as a digital biomarker to enable continuous screening for cognitive impairment.

Analysis and interpretation of inflammatory fluid markers in Alzheimer's disease: a roadmap for standardization.	Growing interest in the role of the immune response in Alzheimer's Disease and related dementias (ADRD) has led to widespread use of fluid inflammatory markers in research studies. To standardize the use and interpretation of inflammatory markers in AD research, we build upon prior guidelines to develop consensus statements and recommendations to advance application and interpretation of these markers. In this roadmap paper, we propose a glossary of terms related to the immune response in the context of biomarker discovery/validation, discuss current conceptualizations of inflammatory markers in research, and recommend best practices to address key knowledge gaps. We also provide consensus principles to summarize primary conceptual, methodological, and interpretative issues facing the field: (1) a single inflammatory marker is likely insufficient to describe an entire biological cascade, and multiple markers with similar or distinct functions should be simultaneously measured in a panel; (2) association studies in humans are insufficient to infer causal relationships or mechanisms; (3) neuroinflammation displays time-dependent and disease context-dependent patterns; (4) neuroinflammatory mechanisms should not be inferred based solely on blood inflammatory marker changes; and (5) standardized reporting of CSF inflammatory marker assay validation and performance will improve incorporation of inflammatory markers into the biological AD criteria.

BACKGROUND: There are no approved oral disease-modifying treatments for Alzheimer's disease (AD). OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to assess efficacy and safety of blarcamesine (ANAVEX®2-73), an orally available small-molecule activator of the sigma-1 receptor (SIGMAR1) in early AD through restoration of cellular homeostasis including autophagy enhancement. DESIGN: ANAVEX2-73-AD-004 was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 48-week Phase IIb/III trial. SETTING: Multicenter - 52 medical research centers/hospitals in 5 countries. INTERVENTION: 508 participants with early AD (Stage 3) were randomized to receive either blarcamesine (n = 338) in medium dose group 30 mg or in high dose group 50 mg or placebo (n = 170) oral capsules once daily for 48 weeks. Participants in these groups were offered to enroll into the open-label-extension study ATTENTION-AD, which completed June 2024, ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT04314934. MEASUREMENTS: The co-primary cognitive and functional outcomes were assessed as change in ADAS-Cog13 and ADCS-ADL from baseline to 48 weeks. The outcomes include the secondary outcome CDR-SB and biomarkers from the A/T/N spectrum, plasma Aβ42/40-ratio and global brain volume changes measured by MRI. All clinical endpoints were analyzed using mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM), plasma biomarker measurements were analyzed by Welch's t-test, and volumetric MRI scans were analyzed by general linear model. RESULTS: Among 462 randomized participants in the intent-to-treat population (mean age, 73.7 years; 225 [48.7%] women), 338 (73.2%) completed the trial. The co-primary outcome was met under the multiplicity control rule, since the differences in the least-squares mean (LSM) change from baseline to 48 weeks between the prespecified blarcamesine and placebo groups for ADAS-Cog13 was significant at a level of P < 0.025 and for CDR-SB was significant at a level of P < 0.025, while ADCS-ADL did not reach significance at Week 48 (ADAS-Cog13 difference of -2.027 [95% CI -3.522 to -0.533]; P = 0.008; CDR-SB difference of -0.483 [95% CI -0.853 to -0.114]; P = 0.010; ADCS-ADL difference of 0.775 [95%CI -0.874 to 2.423]; P = 0.357). Plasma Aβ42/40-ratio increased significantly with blarcamesine group vs. placebo, (P = 0.048) and whole brain volume loss was significantly decreased (P = 0.002). Participants in the full safety population with ≥1 serious treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) occurred in 56 participants (16.7%) in the blarcamesine and 17 (10.1%) in the placebo group. Common TEAEs included dizziness, which was transient and mostly mild to moderate in severity. One death in the blarcamesine group and 1 in the placebo group were both not considered treatment related. CONCLUSIONS: Blarcamesine, demonstrating a safety profile with no associated neuroimaging adverse events, significantly slowed clinical progression by 36.3% at 48 weeks with blarcamesine group as well as the individual 30 mg (by 34.6%) and 50 mg (by 38.5%) blarcamesine groups vs. placebo on the prespecified primary cognitive endpoint ADAS-Cog13. The prespecified secondary endpoint CDR-SB, which is used as the sole primary endpoint in recent successful AD drug submissions, is significantly improved at Week 48 with blarcamesine relative to placebo. The findings are supported by biomarkers from the A/T/N spectrum, including plasma Aβ42/40-ratio and reduction of whole brain atrophy. Additionally, the prespecified SIGMAR1 gene variant subgroup analysis confirmed beneficial clinical effect of blarcamesine group through upstream SIGMAR1 activation - subjects with the common SIGMAR1 wild-type gene (excluding carriers of the mutated SIGMAR1 rs1800866 variant) experienced an even greater significant clinical benefit with slowed clinical progression by 49.8% at 48 weeks on the prespecified primary cognitive endpoint ADAS-Cog13. Oral once daily blarcamesine could represent a novel treatment in early AD and be complementary or alternative to anti-beta amyloid drugs.

Phase 2A Proof-of-Concept Double-Blind, Randomized, Placebo-Controlled Trial of Nicotinamide in Early Alzheimer Disease.	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Nicotinamide is a coenzyme involved in cellular oxidation-reduction reactions that can inhibit Class III histone deacetylases (HDACs) or sirtuins. HDAC inhibition can affect numerous therapeutic pathways, including tau phosphorylation. We tested the hypothesis that nicotinamide treatment could reduce tau phosphorylation in early Alzheimer disease (AD). METHODS: We performed a randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 2a proof-of-concept trial to evaluate the safety and tolerability of 48 weeks of treatment with 1,500 mg of nicotinamide twice a day. The primary outcome was level of tau phosphorylated at threonine 231 (p-tau RESULTS: Of 47 participants enrolled (mean age = 73.8 years; 43% female), 1 dropped out before treatment initiation and 6 before completion, including 2 in the nicotinamide and 4 in the placebo arm. Adverse events (AEs) were balanced by arm, with few attributed to treatment. Common AEs included infections and nervous system disorders. There was no statistically significant benefit of nicotinamide on the primary outcome of week 48 change from baseline in CSF p-tau DISCUSSION: Nicotinamide was safe but did not alter AD biomarkers.

Clinical Predictors of Mortality in People with Severe Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia.	OBJECTIVES: Dementia significantly impacts quality of life, health care costs, and caregiver burden, being a leading cause of death among older adults. We investigated predictors of mortality in people with severe behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD). DESIGN: A multicentric longitudinal observational study was conducted, comprising clinical assessments at baseline and every 6 months for 3 years. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: People with severe BPSD (Neuropsychiatric Inventory, NPI ≥32) living at home. METHODS: Data on demographics and clinical characteristics were collected at baseline and during 6-monthly follow-ups over 3 years. The main outcome was mortality, documented over a total period of 4 years and analyzed using the Cox proportional hazards model. RESULTS: Of the 508 patients with dementia with severe BPSD, 165 (32.5%) died during the 4-year follow-up. Non-survivors were older (79.8 ± 7.7 vs 77.3 ± 8.0; P < .001), more likely to be male (58.8% vs 38.5%; P < .001), and had higher BPSD severity (NPI: 57.2 ± 20.2 vs 50.3 ± 17.9; P < .001), lower cognitive function according to the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) (13.5 ± 6.6 vs 16.4 ± 5.9; P < .001), and worse functional status according to the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study - Activities of Daily Living Scale (ADCS) (28.8 ± 16.4 vs 36.3 ± 17.2; P < .001) at baseline. Significant predictors of mortality included male sex [hazard ratio (HR), 2.03; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 1.46-2.82; P < .001], older age at diagnosis (HR, 1.05; 95% CI, 1.03-1.07; P < .001), higher NPI scores (HR, 1.01; 95% CI, 1.01-1.02; P = .002), lower MMSE (HR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.93-0.98; P = .001), lower ADCS (HR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.98-0.99; P = .015), and lower quality of life rated by proxy (HR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.95-0.99; P = .021). The use of antidepressants (HR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.48-0.98; P = .038) was associated with increased survival. Delusions (HR, 1.0; 95% CI, 1.03-1.12; P < .001), hallucinations (HR, 1.07; 95% CI, 1.02-1.11; P = .002), and agitation/aggression (HR, 1.05; 95% CI, 1.01-1.09; P = .021) were significantly linked to increased mortality. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Older age, male sex, severe BPSD, and lower cognitive and quality of life scores significantly predict increased mortality in patients with severe BPSD.

Post hoc analysis of ADAMANT, a phase 2 clinical trial of active tau immunotherapy with AADvac1 in patients with Alzheimer's disease, positive for plasma p-tau217.	BACKGROUND: The spread of tau pathology closely correlates with the disease course and cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Tau-targeting immunotherapies are being developed to stop the spread of tau pathology and thus halt disease progression. In this post hoc analysis of the ADAMANT clinical trial, we examined the performance of AADvac1, an active immunotherapy targeting the microtubule-binding region (MTBR) of tau, in a subgroup of participants with elevated plasma p-tau217, indicating AD-related neuropathological changes. METHODS: ADAMANT was a 24-month, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, double-blinded, multicenter, phase 2 clinical trial in subjects with mild AD. The trial participants were randomized 3:2 to receive six doses of AADvac1 or placebo at 4-week intervals, followed by five booster doses at 14-week intervals. The primary outcome was safety. The secondary outcomes were the Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB), the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study - Activities of Daily Living score for Mild Cognitive Impairment 18-item version (ADCS-ADL-MCI-18), and immunogenicity. Volumetric MRI, plasma neurofilament light (NfL), and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) were exploratory outcomes. The inclusion criterion for this post-hoc analysis was a baseline plasma p-tau217 level above the cutoff for AD. RESULTS: Among 196 ADAMANT participants, 137 were positive for plasma p-tau217 (mean age 71.4 years, 59% women). AADvac1 was safe and well tolerated in this subgroup. AADvac1 reduced the rate of accumulation of log-plasma NfL by 56% and that of GFAP by 73%. The treatment differences in the CDR-SB and ADCS-ADL-MCI-18 scores favored AADvac1 but were not statistically significant. AADvac1 had no effect on whole-brain volume but nonsignificantly reduced the loss of brain cortical tissue in several regions. Importantly, the impact on the study outcomes was more pronounced in participants with higher anti-tau antibody levels. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that AADvac1 tau immunotherapy can reduce plasma biomarkers of neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation. These findings and possible observations on brain atrophy and cognition are hypothesis-generating and warrant further evaluation in a larger clinical trial.

Axonal damage and inflammation response are biological correlates of decline in small-world values: a cohort study in autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease.	The grey matter of the brain develops and declines in coordinated patterns during the lifespan. Such covariation patterns of grey matter structure can be quantified as grey matter networks, which can be measured with magnetic resonance imaging. In Alzheimer's disease, the global organization of grey matter networks becomes more random, which is captured by a decline in the small-world coefficient. Such decline in the small-world value has been robustly associated with cognitive decline across clinical stages of Alzheimer's disease. The biological mechanisms causing this decline in small-world values remain unknown. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) protein biomarkers are available for studying diverse pathological mechanisms in humans and can provide insight into decline. We investigated the relationships between 10 CSF proteins and small-world coefficient in mutation carriers (	autosomal dominant Alzheimer disease; axonal damage; inflammation; neuronal injury; structural covariance network

The AlzMatch Pilot Study - Feasibility of Remote Blood Collection of Plasma Biomarkers for Preclinical Alzheimer's Disease Trials.	BACKGROUND: Advances in plasma biomarkers to detect Alzheimer's disease (AD) biology allows researchers to improve the efficiency of participant recruitment into preclinical trials. Recently, protein levels of plasma amyloid-beta and tau proteins have been shown to be predictive of elevated amyloid in brain. Online registries, such as the Alzheimer's Prevention Trials (APT) Webstudy, include and follow participants using remote assessments to facilitate efficient screening and enrollment of large numbers of individuals who may be at higher risk for AD. OBJECTIVES: The AlzMatch Pilot Study investigated the feasibility of recruiting individuals from an online registry for blood sample collection at community-based phlebotomy centers and plasma biomarker quantification to assess an individual's eligibility for AD preclinical trials. DESIGN: Pilot feasibility study with co-primary outcomes. SETTING: This pilot feasibility study included participants from the APT Webstudy, the remote assessment arm of the Trial-ready cohort for Preclinical and Prodromal AD (TRC-PAD) Platform. Novel design included collection of electronic consent, use of community laboratories for plasma collection, mass spectrometry-based biomarker assay, and telephone communication of plasma biomarker screening eligibility. PARTICIPANTS: Participants invited to the AlzMatch pilot feasibility study were active in the APT Webstudy, 50 years of age or older, resided within 50 miles of both a Quest Diagnostics Patient Services Center (a national diagnostic laboratory with convenient locations for sample collection and processing) and one of six TRC-PAD vanguard clinical trial sites, had no self-reported dementia diagnosis, were able to communicate in English and engaged with the APT Webstudy within the prior 6 months. MEASUREMENTS: Primary feasibility outcomes were completion of electronic consent (e-consent) for invited participants and collection of usable blood samples. Additional feasibility outcomes included invitation response rate, plasma biomarker eligibility status (based on amyloid beta-42/40 [Aβ42/40] concentration ratio), ApoE proteotype, and trial inclusion criterion), and completion of telephone contact to learn eligibility to screen for a study. RESULTS: 300 APT Webstudy participants were invited to consent to the AlzMatch study. The AlzMatch e-consent rate was 39% (n=117) (95% CI of 33.5%-44.5%) overall, which was higher than the expected rate of 25%. Similar consent rates were observed across participants based on self-defined sex (41% Female (n=75), 37% Male (n=42)) and race and ethnicity (37% from underrepresented groups (URG) (n=36), 40% not from URG (n=79)). Among those that consented (n=117), plasma was successfully collected from 74% (n=87) (95% CI of 66%-82%), with similar rates across sex (76% Female (n=57), 71% Male (n=30)) and race and ethnicity (75% URG (n=27) and 75% not from URG (n=59)). 60% (n=51) of participants with plasma biomarker results were eligible to screen for future preclinical AD trials. CONCLUSION: Electronic consent of participants through an online registry, blood sample collection at community-based centers, plasma biomarker quantification and reporting, and biomarker assessments for study eligibility were all feasible with similar engagement rates across demographic groups. Although this pilot was a small and selective sample, participants engaged and consented at higher than expected rates. We conclude that collecting blood at community laboratories for biomarker analyses may improve accessibility beyond research, and may facilitate broader access for clinical use of AD plasma biomarkers. Based on our results, an expanded version of the AlzMatch study is underway, which involves expanding invitations to additional APT Webstudy participants and clinical trial sites.

A framework for translating tauopathy therapeutics: Drug discovery to clinical trials.	"The tauopathies are defined by pathological tau protein aggregates within a spectrum of clinically heterogeneous neurodegenerative diseases. The primary tauopathies meet the definition of rare diseases in the United States. There is no approved treatment for primary tauopathies. In this context, designing the most efficient development programs to translate promising targets and treatments from preclinical studies to early-phase clinical trials is vital. In September 2022, the Rainwater Charitable Foundation convened an international expert workshop focused on the translation of tauopathy therapeutics through early-phase trials. Our report on the workshop recommends a framework for principled drug development and a companion lexicon to facilitate communication focusing on reproducibility and achieving common elements. Topics include the selection of targets, drugs, biomarkers, participants, and study designs. The maturation of pharmacodynamic biomarkers to demonstrate target engagement and surrogate disease biomarkers is a crucial unmet need. HIGHLIGHTS: Experts provided a framework to translate therapeutics (discovery to clinical trials). Experts focused on the ""5 Rights"" (target, drug, biomarker, participants, trial). Current research on frontotemporal degeneration, progressive supranuclear palsy, and corticobasal syndrome therapeutics includes 32 trials (37% on biologics) Tau therapeutics are being tested in Alzheimer's disease; primary tauopathies have a large unmet need."	biomarkers; development; early‐phase clinical trials; preclinical; tauopathy; therapeutics

Decreased functional connectivity is associated with increased levels of Cerebral Spinal Fluid soluble-PDGFRβ, a marker of blood brain barrier breakdown, in older adults.	Resting-state functional connectivity (FC) is suggested to be cross-sectionally associated with both vascular burden and Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. For instance, studies in pre-clinical AD subjects have shown increases of cerebral spinal fluid soluble platelet-derived growth factor receptor-β (CSF sPDGFRβ, a marker of BBB breakdown) but have not demonstrated if this vascular impairment affects neuronal dysfunction. It's possible that increased levels of sPDGFRβ in the CSF may correlate with impaired FC in metabolically demanding brain regions (i.e. Default Mode Network, DMN). Our study aimed to investigate the relationship between these two markers in older individuals that were cognitively normal and had cognitive impairment. Eighty-nine older adults without dementia from the University of Southern California were selected from a larger cohort. Region of interest (ROI) to ROI analyses were conducted using DMN seed regions. Linear regression models measured significant associations between BOLD FC strength among seed-target regions and sPDGFRβ values, while covarying for age and sex. Comparison of a composite ROI created by averaging FC values between seed and all target regions among cognitively normal and impaired individuals was also examined. Using CSF sPDGFRβ as a biomarker of BBB breakdown, we report that increased breakdown correlated with decreased functional connectivity in DMN areas, specifically the PCC, and while the hippocampus exhibited an interaction effect using CDR score, this was an exploratory analysis that we feel can lead to further research. Ultimately, we found that BBB breakdown, as measured by CSF sPDGFRβ, is associated with neural networks, and decreased functional connections.

Comparative Efficacy and Safety of Monoclonal Antibodies for Cognitive Decline in Patients with Alzheimer's Disease: A Systematic Review and Network Meta-Analysis.	BACKGROUND: Recent clinical trials of anti-Aβ monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) in the treatment of early Alzheimer's disease (AD) have produced encouraging cognitive and clinical results. The purpose of this network meta-analysis (NMA) was to compare and rank mAb drugs according to their efficacy and safety. METHODS: PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library were searched for randomized controlled trials testing various mAbs for the treatment of cognitive decline in patients with AD, up to March 31, 2023. R software (version 4.2.3) along with JAGS and STATA software (version 15.0) were used for statistical analysis. Odds ratio (OR) for binary variables, mean difference (MD) for continuous variables, and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) were utilized to estimate treatment effects and rank probabilities for each mAb in terms of safety and efficacy outcomes. We calculated the surface under the cumulative ranking area (SUCRA) to evaluate each mAb, with higher SUCRA values indicating better efficacy or lower likelihood of adverse events. RESULTS: Thirty-three randomized controlled trials with a total of 21,087 patients were included in the current NMA, involving eight different mAbs. SUCRA values showed that aducanumab (87.01% and 99.37%, respectively) was the most likely to achieve the best therapeutic effect based on the changes of Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Clinical Dementia Rating scale Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) scores. Donanemab (88.50% and 99.00%, respectively) performed better than other therapies for Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog) and Positron Emission Tomography-Standardized Uptake Value ratio (PET-SUVr). Lecanemab (87.24%) may be the most promising way to slow down the decrease of Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living (ADCS-ADL) score. In the analysis of the incidence of adverse events (subjects with any treatment-emergent adverse event), gantenerumab (89.12%) had the least potential for adverse events, while lecanemab (0.79%) may cause more adverse events. Solanezumab (95.75% and 80.38%, respectively) had the lowest incidence of amyloid-related imaging abnormalities characterized by edema and effusion (ARIA-E) and by cerebral microhemorrhages (ARIA-H) of the included immunotherapies. While SUCRA values provided a comprehensive measure of treatment efficacy, the inherent statistical uncertainty required careful analysis in clinical application. CONCLUSION: Despite immunotherapies significantly increasing the risks of adverse events and ARIA, the data suggest that mAbs can effectively improve the cognitive function of patients with mild and moderate AD. According to the NMA, aducanumab was the most likely to achieve significant improvements in different cognitive and clinical assessments (statistically improved MMSE and CDR-SB), followed by donanemab (statistically improved ADAS-Cog, and PET-SUVr) and lecanemab (statistically improved ADCS-ADL).

Cerebrovascular reactivity in Alzheimer's disease signature regions is associated with mild cognitive impairment in adults with hypertension.	INTRODUCTION: Vascular risk factors contribute to cognitive decline suggesting that maintaining cerebrovascular health could reduce dementia risk. The objective of this study is to evaluate the association of cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR), a measure of brain blood vessel elasticity, with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia. METHODS: Participants were enrolled in the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial Memory and Cognition in Decreased Hypertension (SPRINT-MIND) magnetic resonance imaging substudy. Baseline CVR in Alzheimer's disease (AD) signature regions were primary variables of interest. The occipital pole and postcentral gyrus were included as control regions. RESULTS: Higher AD composite CVR was associated with lower MCI risk. No significant associations between inferior temporal gyrus, occipital pole, or postcentral gyrus CVR and MCI risk, or any regional CVR-combined risk associations were observed. DISCUSSION: CVR in AD signature regions is negatively associated with occurrence of MCI, implicating CVR in AD signature regions as a potential mechanism leading to cognitive impairment.	biomarkers; cerebrovascular reactivity; cognitive dysfunction; hypertension; mild cognitive impairment

"Efficacy assessment of an active tau immunotherapy in Alzheimer's disease patients with amyloid and tau pathology: a post hoc analysis of the ""ADAMANT"" randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multi-centre, phase 2 clinical trial."	BACKGROUND: Tau pathology correlates with and predicts clinical decline in Alzheimer's disease. Approved tau-targeted therapies are not available. METHODS: ADAMANT, a 24-month randomised, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, double-blinded, multicenter, Phase 2 clinical trial (EudraCT2015-000630-30, NCT02579252) enrolled 196 participants with Alzheimer's disease; 119 are included in this post-hoc subgroup analysis. AADvac1, active immunotherapy against pathological tau protein. A machine learning model predicted likely Amyloid+Tau+ participants from baseline MRI. STATISTICAL METHODS: MMRM for change from baseline in cognition, function, and neurodegeneration; linear regression for associations between antibody response and endpoints. RESULTS: The prediction model achieved PPV of 97.7% for amyloid, 96.2% for tau. 119 participants in the full analysis set (70 treatment and 49 placebo) were classified as A+T+. A trend for CDR-SB 104-week change (estimated marginal means [emm] = -0.99 points, 95% CI [-2.13, 0.13], p = 0.0825]) and ADCS-MCI-ADL (emm = 3.82 points, CI [-0.29, 7.92], p = 0.0679) in favour of the treatment group was seen. Reduction was seen in plasma NF-L (emm = -0.15 log pg/mL, CI [-0.27, -0.03], p = 0.0139). Higher antibody response to AADvac1 was related to slowing of decline on CDR-SB (rho = -0.10, CI [-0.21, 0.01], p = 0.0376) and ADL (rho = 0.15, CI [0.03, 0.27], p = 0.0201), and related to slower brain atrophy (rho = 0.18-0.35, p < 0.05 for temporal volume, whole cortex, and right and left hippocampus). CONCLUSIONS: In the subgroup of ML imputed or CSF identified A+T+, AADvac1 slowed AD-related decline in an antibody-dependent manner. Larger anti-tau trials are warranted.

The FDA-approved anti-amyloid-β monoclonal antibodies for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.	BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a worldwide public health problem and is difficult to cure. Drugs aimed at slowing the progression of the disease have been developed, with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granting accelerated approval for aducanumab on June 21, 2021 and a new accelerated approval for lecanemab on January 22, 2023. We performed this systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the efficacy and safety of FDA-approved anti-amyloid-β (anti-Aβ) monoclonal antibodies (mabs) for the treatment of AD. METHOD: PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library were systematically searched to identify relevant studies published before May 2023. Efficacy outcomes included Aβ, neuroimaging, and biomarker outcomes. Safety outcomes included amyloid-related imaging abnormalities with edema or effusions (ARIA-E) and ARIA with cerebral microhemorrhages, cerebral macrohemorrhages, or superficial siderosis (ARIA-H). Review Manager 5.4 software was used to assess the data. The standard mean differences (SMDs) or odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (95% CI) were analyzed and calculated with a random effect model or a fixed effect model. RESULT: Overall, 4471 patients from 6 randomized controlled trials (RCTs), with 2190 patients in the treatment group and 2281 patients in the placebo group meeting the inclusion criteria. FDA-approved anti-Aβ mabs showed statistically significant improvements in clinical outcomes, including CDR-SB (P = 0.01), ADCS-ADL-MCI (P = 0.00003), ADCOMS (P < 0.00001), ADAS-Cog (P < 0.00001). Moreover, FDA-approved anti-Aβ mabs increased cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Aβ1-42 (P = 0.002) and plasma Aβ42/40 ratios (P = 0.0008). They also decreased CSF P-Tau (P < 0.00001), CSF T-Tau (P < 0.00001), and plasma p-tau181 (P < 0.00001). FDA-approved anti-Aβ mabs perform neuroimaging changes in amyloid Positron Emission Tomography Standardized Uptake Value ratio (PET SUVr) (P < 0.00001). However, compared with placebo, FDA-approved anti-Aβ mabs had higher risk of ARIA-E (P < 0.00001) and ARIA-H (P < 0001). CONCLUSION: FDA-approved anti-Aβ mabs have a role in slowing disease progression in patients with AD, at the cost of an increased probability of side effects.

Wrist-worn sensor-based measurements for drug effect detection with small samples in people with Lewy Body Dementia.	INTRODUCTION: Few late-stage clinical trials in Parkinson's disease (PD) have produced evidence on the clinical validity of sensor-based digital measurements of daily life activities to detect responses to treatment. The objective of this study was to assess whether digital measures from patients with mild-to-moderate Lewy Body Dementia demonstrate treatment effects during a randomized Phase 2 trial. METHODS: Substudy within a 12-week trial of mevidalen (placebo vs 10, 30, or 75 mg), where 70/344 patients (comparable to the overall population) wore a wrist-worn multi-sensor device. RESULTS: Treatment effects were statistically significant by conventional clinical assessments (Movement Disorder Society-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale [MDS-UPDRS] sum of Parts I-III and Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Clinical Global Impression of Change [ADCS-CGIC] scores) in the full study cohort at Week 12, but not in the substudy. However, digital measurements detected significant effects in the substudy cohort at week 6, persisting to week 12. CONCLUSIONS: Digital measurements detected treatment effects in a smaller cohort over a shorter period than conventional clinical assessments. TRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov, NCT03305809.

The Use of Episodic Memory Tests for Screening in Clinical Trials for Early Alzheimer's Disease: A Comparison of the Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test (FCSRT) and the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS).	BACKGROUND: Screening procedures for early Alzheimer's disease (AD) trials seek to efficiently identify participants who fulfill clinical and biomarker criteria for AD and enrich for those most likely to experience significant clinical progression during the study. Episodic memory performance is often assessed in screening, but the utility of different memory tests for optimizing screening efficiency and/or rates of clinical progression remains uncertain. OBJECTIVES: Cross-study comparisons of the effects of inclusion criteria based on performance on the Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test (FCSRT) or the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) on screen-failure rates for episodic memory and β-amyloid (Aβ) positivity (by CSF or PET) and on subsequent rates of clinical disease progression in randomized participants across three clinical trials in early (prodromal-to-mild) AD. DESIGN: Secondary analyses of cross-sectional and longitudinal clinical trial data. SETTING: Multi-center international clinical trials. PARTICIPANTS: Individuals with prodromal-to-mild AD screened and/or randomized in clinical trials for crenezumab (CREAD, CREAD2) or semorinemab (Tauriel). Cross-sectional analyses of screening data for episodic memory impairment included participants from CREAD2 (n=2897) and Tauriel (n=887) and for Aβ positivity included participants from CREAD (n=1138), CREAD2 (n=1119), and Tauriel (n=483). Longitudinal analyses of rates of clinical progression included participants from CREAD (n=779), CREAD2 (n=773), and Tauriel (n=331). MEASUREMENTS: Cross-sectional analyses examined eligibility rates per cutoffs defined for the FCSRT (CREAD, CREAD2) or RBANS (Tauriel) and per Aβ positivity using CSF and/or PET biomarkers. Longitudinal analyses examined rates of clinical progression on the Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB), the 13-item version of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog13), and Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living Scale (ADCS-ADL). RESULTS: Lower rates of study eligibility per episodic memory criteria were seen with the FCSRT (CREAD2) relative to the RBANS (Tauriel), but similar rates of eligibility per Aβ positivity criteria were seen amongst participants with episodic memory impairment per the cutoffs used on either assessment. Similar rates of clinical decline over 18 months on the CDR-SB, ADAS-Cog13, and ADCS-ADL were observed in study populations enriched using the FCSRT (CREAD, CREAD2) or the RBANS (Tauriel). CONCLUSIONS: Cutoffs for episodic memory impairment on the FCSRT used in the CREAD and CREAD2 studies are more stringent than those on the RBANS used in the Tauriel study, resulting in lower rates of eligibility. However, given that study enrichment with either test yields similar rates of Aβ positivity and clinical progression, considerations beyond these factors may drive the decision of which assessment to use for screening in early AD clinical trials.

Multimodal brain age estimates relate to Alzheimer disease biomarkers and cognition in early stages: a cross-sectional observational study.	BACKGROUND: Estimates of 'brain-predicted age' quantify apparent brain age compared to normative trajectories of neuroimaging features. The brain age gap (BAG) between predicted and chronological age is elevated in symptomatic Alzheimer disease (AD) but has not been well explored in presymptomatic AD. Prior studies have typically modeled BAG with structural MRI, but more recently other modalities, including functional connectivity (FC) and multimodal MRI, have been explored. METHODS: We trained three models to predict age from FC, structural (S), or multimodal MRI (S+FC) in 390 amyloid-negative cognitively normal (CN/A-) participants (18-89 years old). In independent samples of 144 CN/A-, 154 CN/A+, and 154 cognitively impaired (CI; CDR > 0) participants, we tested relationships between BAG and AD biomarkers of amyloid and tau, as well as a global cognitive composite. RESULTS: All models predicted age in the control training set, with the multimodal model outperforming the unimodal models. All three BAG estimates were significantly elevated in CI compared to controls. FC-BAG was significantly reduced in CN/A+ participants compared to CN/A-. In CI participants only, elevated S-BAG and S+FC BAG were associated with more advanced AD pathology and lower cognitive performance. CONCLUSIONS: Both FC-BAG and S-BAG are elevated in CI participants. However, FC and structural MRI also capture complementary signals. Specifically, FC-BAG may capture a unique biphasic response to presymptomatic AD pathology, while S-BAG may capture pathological progression and cognitive decline in the symptomatic stage. A multimodal age-prediction model improves sensitivity to healthy age differences. FUNDING: This work was supported by the National Institutes of Health (P01-AG026276, P01- AG03991, P30-AG066444, 5-R01-AG052550, 5-R01-AG057680, 1-R01-AG067505, 1S10RR022984-01A1, and U19-AG032438), the BrightFocus Foundation (A2022014F), and the Alzheimer's Association (SG-20-690363-DIAN). The brains of people with advanced Alzheimer’s disease often look older than expected based on the patients’ actual age. This ‘brain age gap’ (how old a brain appears compared to the person’s chronological age) can be calculated thanks to machine learning algorithms which analyse images of the organ to detect changes related to aging. Traditionally, these models have relied on images of the brain structure, such as the size and thickness of various brain areas; more recent models have started to use activity data, such as how different brain regions work together to form functional networks. While the brain age gap is a useful measure for researchers who investigate aging and disease, it is not yet helpful for clinicians. For example, it is unclear whether the machine learning algorithm could detect changes in the brains of individuals in the initial stages of Alzheimer’s disease, before they start to manifest cognitive symptoms. Millar et al. explored this question by testing whether models which incorporate structural and activity data could be more sensitive to these early changes. Three machine learning algorithms (relying on either structural data, activity data, or combination of both) were used to predict the brain ages of participants with no sign of disease; with biological markers of Alzheimer’s disease but preserved cognitive functions; and with marked cognitive symptoms of the condition. Overall, the combined model was slightly better at predicting the brain age of healthy volunteers, and all three models indicated that patients with dementia had a brain which looked older than normal. For this group, the model based on structural data was also able to make predictions which reflected the severity of cognitive decline. Crucially, the algorithm which used activity data predicted that, in individuals with biological markers of Alzheimer’s disease but no cognitive impairment, the brain looked in fact younger than chronological age. Exactly why this is the case remains unclear, but this signal may be driven by neural processes which unfold in the early stages of the disease. While more research is needed, the work by Millar et al. helps to explore how various types of machine learning models could one day be used to assess and predict brain health.

Efficacy and safety of hypoglycemic drugs in improving cognitive function in patients with Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment: A systematic review and network meta-analysis.	OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of oral hypoglycaemic drugs (HDs) on cognitive function and biomarkers of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) through a network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs). METHODS: We conducted systematic searches for English- and Chinese-language articles in the PubMed, Medline, Embase, Cochrane Library and Google Scholar databases, with no date restrictions. We performed a network meta-analysis, which we report here according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). The 16 studies included a total of 3,081 patients. We selected the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive section (ADAS-Cog), the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study Activities of Daily Living section (ADCS-ADL) and amyloid beta (Aβ) 42 as the outcome measures for analysis and comparison. RESULT: We selected seven treatments and assessed the clinical trials in which they were tested against a placebo control. Of these treatments, intranasal insulin 20 IU (ITSN20), glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitor (DPP-4) were associated with significantly improved MMSE scores (7 RCTs, 333 patients, 30≥MMSE score≥20: mild) compared with placebo [standardized mean difference (SMD) 1.11, 95% confidence interval (CI) (0.87, 1.35); SMD 0.75, 95% CI (0.04, 1.41); and SMD 4.08, 95% CI (3.39, 4.77), respectively]. Rosiglitazone 4 mg (RLZ4), rosiglitazone 10 mg (RLZ10), intranasal insulin 40 IU (ITSN40), and ITSN20 significantly decreased ADAS-Cog scores (11 RCTs, 4044 patients, 10 ≤ ADAS-Cog scores ≤ 30: mild and moderate) compared with placebo [SMD -1.40, 95% CI (-2.57, -0.23), SMD -3.02, 95% CI (-4.17, -1.86), SMD -0.92, 95% CI (-1.77, -0.08), SMD -1.88, 95% CI (-3.09, -0.66)]. Additionally, ITSN20 and ITSN40 significantly improved ADCS-ADL scores (2 RCTs, 208 patients, ADCS-ADL scale score ≤ 10: mild) compared with placebo [SMD 0.02, 95% CI (0.01, 0.03), and SMD 0.04, 95% CI (0.03, 0.05), respectively]. In the 16 included studies, the degree of AD was classified as mild or moderate. For mild cognitive impairment, DPP-4 performed best, but for mild to moderate impairment, ITSN40 had excellent performance. CONCLUSION: Various HDs can improve the cognitive function of MCI and AD patients. Different drug regimens brought different degrees of improvement, which may be related to their dosage, duration, and mechanism of action. SYSTEMATIC REVIEW REGISTRATION: www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero.

Brain and blood transcriptome-wide association studies identify five novel genes associated with Alzheimer's disease.	BackgroundGenome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified numerous genetic variants associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD), but their functional implications remain unclear. Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) offer enhanced statistical power by analyzing genetic associations at the gene level rather than at the variant level, enabling assessment of how genetically-regulated gene expression influences AD risk. However, previous AD-TWAS have been limited by small expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) reference datasets or reliance on AD-by-proxy phenotypes.ObjectiveTo perform the most powerful AD-TWAS to date using summary statistics from the largest available brain and blood	Alzheimer's disease; expression quantitative trait loci; gene expression; transcriptome-wide association studies; transcriptomics

BACKGROUND: Event-based modeling (EBM) traces sequential progression of events in complex processes like neurodegenerative diseases, adept at handling uncertainties. This study validated an EBM for Alzheimer's disease (AD) staging designed by EuroPOND, an EU-funded Horizon 2020 project, using research and real-world datasets, a crucial step towards application in multi-center trials. METHODS: The training dataset comprised 1737 subjects from ADNI-1/GO/2, using the EuroPOND EBM toolbox. Testing datasets included a research cohort from University of Antwerp (controls, CN (n = 46), subjective cognitive decline, SCD (n = 10), mild cognitive impairment, MCI (n = 47), AD dementia, ADD (n = 16)) and a real-world cohort from 9 Belgian Dementia Council memory clinics (CN (n = 91), SCD (n = 66), (non-amnestic) naMCI (n = 54), aMCI (n = 255), and ADD (n = 220). Biomarkers included: 2 clinical scores (Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT)); 3 CSF-biomarkers (Aβ RESULTS: The research cohort's maximum likelihood event sequence comprised CSF Aβ CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the generalizability of EuroPOND's AD EBM model across research and real-world clinical datasets, supporting its use in multi-center trials. aMCI subjects generally reside in more advanced stages than naMCI, who may not necessarily have AD, demonstrating utility for precision recruitment/screening.

Baseline serum glutamate: Implications for diagnosis and prediction in mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative.	PURPOSE: Numerous studies have highlighted a close link between metabolic imbalances and Alzheimer's Disease (AD). The advancement of metabolomics has recently enabled the exploration of characteristic metabolic changes associated with AD. Studies indicate that serum glutamate (Glu) levels may correlate with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD. This study aims to further elucidate the characteristics of baseline serum Glu levels in MCI and AD. METHODS: This study included 783 participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative-1 (ADNI-1) cohort, categorized into cognitively normal (CN, n = 224), stable MCI (sMCI, n = 181), progressive MCI (pMCI, n = 193), and AD (n = 185). The study aimed to analyze the diagnostic value of baseline serum Glu, to explore its predictive capability for the progression from CN to MCI or AD, and from MCI to AD, and to analyze the relationship between serum Glu and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers and cognitive functions in different diagnostic groups. RESULTS: Compared to the CN and sMCI groups, the pMCI group showed significantly lower levels of serum Glu, and the AD group also had lower Glu levels compared to the sMCI group. However, serum Glu did not show significant diagnostic value for MCI and AD. Lower levels of serum Glu could predict the progression from MCI to AD. CONCLUSION: Serum Glu levels can predict the progression from MCI to AD, suggesting that it could provide new insights into the pathophysiological mechanisms of AD. However, serum Glu may not be an ideal peripheral biomarker for AD.	Alzheimer’s Disease; Glutamate; Mild Cognitive Impairment

Regional Comparison of Imaging Biomarkers in the Striatum between Early- and Late-onset Alzheimer's Disease.	Striatal changes in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is not fully understood yet. We compared structural and functional image differences in the striatum between patients with early onset AD (EOAD) and late onset AD (LOAD) to investigate whether EOAD harbors autosomal dominant AD like imaging findings. The clinical, neuropsychological and neuroimaging biomarkers of 77 probable AD patients and 107 elderly subjects with normal cognition (NC) from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI)-2 dataset were analyzed. Enrolled each subject completed a 3-Tesla MRI, baseline 18F-FDG-PET, and baseline 18F-AV-45 (Florbetapir) amyloid PET studies. AD patients were divided into two groups based on the onset age of clinical symptoms (EOAD <65 yrs; LOAD ≥65 yrs). A standardized uptake value ratio of the striatum and subcortical structures was obtained from both amyloid and FDG-PET scans. Structural MR imaging analysis was conducted using a parametric boundary description protocol, SPHARM-PDM. Of the 77 AD patients, 18 were EOAD and 59 were LOAD. Except for age of symptom onset, there were no statistically significant differences between the groups in demographics and detailed neuropsychological test results. 18F-AV-45 amyloid PET showed marked β-amyloid accumulation in the bilateral caudate nucleus and left pallidum in the EOAD group. Intriguingly, the caudate nucleus and putamen showed maintained glucose metabolism in the EOAD group compared to the LOAD group. Our image findings in the striatum of EOAD patients suggest that sporadic EOAD may share some pathophysiological changes noted in autosomal dominant AD.

Continuum of Core 1 Biomarkers in Preclinical Alzheimer's Disease.	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Biological Staging for Alzheimer's disease (AD) in clinically unimpaired (CU) individuals is critical for early detection efforts. In this study, we evaluated whether Core 1 biomarkers (plasma ptau-217 and amyloid-PET) within Biological Stage A, the earliest biological stage of AD, predicts progression of downstream biomarkers and cognition. METHODS: We used baseline plasma ptau-217 and amyloid-PET, and longitudinal tau-PET, atrophy, and cognition data from the recently completed Anti-Amyloid Treatment in Asymptomatic Alzheimer's (A4) Study. PET data were used to identify participants within AD Biological Stage A (amyloid-PET positive and medial temporal tau-PET negative). Within these Stage A participants, linear mixed effects models were used to examine associations between continuous baseline levels of plasma p-tau217 and amyloid-PET burden with longitudinal regional tau-PET, atrophy, and cognition. We additionally evaluated whether continuous p-tau217 and amyloid-PET burden within this group was associated with higher risk of progression to Biological Stage B+ (tau-PET positive in the medial temporal lobe). In our statistical models, we included covariates for age, sex, and APOE4 carriage. RESULTS: Of 335 A4 participants with complete biomarker data, 222 were identified as being in Biological Stage A. Among Biological Stage A CU, continuous baseline plasma p-tau217 and amyloid-PET burden were independently associated with faster tau-PET accumulation and atrophy in AD-relevant regions (mean follow-up time for both tau-PET and MRI: 4.2 years), as well as faster cognitive decline (mean follow-up time for PACC: 5.7 years) (all p<0.05). Plasma p-tau217 and amyloid-PET burden were independently associated with higher risk of progression to Biological Stage B+. DISCUSSION: In CU individuals, early changing AD biomarkers during the initial stage of AD (Biological Stage A) provide prognostic information of downstream markers of disease. Evaluation of the utility of these continuous measures in a real-world setting is warranted. CLINICAL TRIAL INFORMATION: The A4 study was submitted for registration to clinicaltrials.gov on December 6th, 2023. The study is registered with ID NCT02008357. Screening and data collection for the study began in April 2014.

Multimodal prognostic modeling of individual cognitive trajectories to enhance trial efficiency in preclinical Alzheimer's disease.	INTRODUCTION: Cognitive decline in asymptomatic preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD) is slow and variable, limiting detection of treatment effects. This study developed models to forecast trajectories and improve trial efficiency. METHODS: Models were trained on longitudinal Preclinical Alzheimer's Cognitive Composite (PACC) data up to 240 weeks from the Phase III A4 study of solanezumab. Baseline inputs included demographics, apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4, clinical scores, amyloid positron emission tomography (PET), plasma pTau217, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and tau PET (sub-study). Stochastic gradient boosting was used, with evaluation via cross-validation and trial simulations. RESULTS: The best model without tau PET used pTau217, clinical, and MRI data (R DISCUSSION: Prognostic models can predict decline in preclinical AD and improve trial efficiency. GOV IDENTIFIERS: NCT02008357 (Clinical Trial of Solanezumab for Older Individuals Who May be at Risk for Memory Loss (A4)) HIGHLIGHTS: Models forecast 4.5-year cognitive decline in amyloid-positive preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD). Plasma pTau217 and tau positron emission tomography (PET) standardized uptake value ratios (SUVRs) in early-accumulating regions are key predictors. Tau PET improves prediction beyond plasma, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and clinical measures. Forecasted decline as a prognostic covariate improves power and cuts sample size in trial simulations. Alternative models underperform yet retain practical utility when tau PET or pTau217 is unavailable.

Cognitive function instrument-based anosognosia to predict amyloid status.	Anosognosia, a lack of self-awareness regarding cognitive dysfunction, often accompanies the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. This study explored the relationship between AD pathology and anosognosia measured by discrepancies in Cognitive Function Instrument (CFI) scores, as rated by participants and their study partners (SP). Using mixed-effects models on non-demented participant data, the results revealed that lower self-reported CFI score compared to SP ratings was significantly associated with positive amyloid PET results (odds ratio 1.081 per-1 decrease in ΔCFI).

Pre-Randomization Predictors of Study Discontinuation in a Preclinical Alzheimer's Disease Randomized Controlled Trial.	BACKGROUND: Participant discontinuation from study treatment in a clinical trial can leave a trial underpowered, produce bias in statistical analysis, and limit interpretability of study results. Retaining participants in clinical trials for the full study duration is therefore as important as participant recruitment. OBJECTIVE: This analysis aims to identify associations of pre-randomization characteristics of participants with premature discontinuation during the blinded phase of the Anti-Amyloid treatment in Asymptomatic AD (A4) Study. DESIGN: All A4 trial randomized participants were classified as having prematurely discontinued study during the blinded period of the study for any reason (dropouts) or completed the blinded phase of the study on treatment (completers). SETTING: The trial was conducted across 67 study sites in the United States, Canada, Japan and Australia through the global COVID-19 pandemic. PARTICIPANTS: The sample consisted of all 1169 A4 trial randomized participants. MEASUREMENTS: Pre-randomization demographic, clinical, amyloid PET and genetic predictors of study discontinuation were evaluated using a univariate generalized linear mixed model (GLMM), with discontinuation status as the binary outcome, each predictor as a fixed effect, and site as a random effect to account for differences among study sites in the trial. Characteristics significant at p<0.10 were then included in a multivariable GLMM. RESULTS: Among randomized participants, 339 (29%) discontinued the study during the blinded period (median follow-up time in trial: 759 days). From the multivariable analysis, the two main predictors of study discontinuation were screening State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) scores (OR = 1.07 [95%CI = 1.02; 1.12]; p=0.002) and age (OR = 1.06 [95%CI = 1.03; 1.09]; p<0.001). Participants with a family history of dementia (OR = 0.75 [95%CI = 0.55; 1.01]; p=0.063) and APOE ε4 carriers (OR = 0.79 [95%CI = 0.6; 1.04]; p=0.094) were less likely to discontinue from the study, with the association being marginally significant. In these analyses, sex, race and ethnicity, cognitive scores and amyloid/tau PET scores were not associated with study dropout. CONCLUSIONS: In the A4 trial, older participants and those with higher levels of anxiety at baseline as measured by the STAI were more likely to discontinue while those who had a family history of dementia or were APOE ε4 carriers were less likely to drop out. These findings have direct implications for future preclinical trial design and selection processes to identify those individuals at greatest risk of dropout and provide information to the study team to develop effective selection and retention strategies in AD prevention studies.

Greater White Matter Hyperintensity Volume Is Associated with the Number of Microhemorrhages in Preclinical Alzheimer's Disease.	BACKGROUND: Increased white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volume visible on MRI is a common finding in Alzheimer's disease (AD). We hypothesized that WMH in preclinical AD is associated with the presence of advanced vessel amyloidosis manifested as microhemorrhages (MCH). OBJECTIVES: 1) To assess the relationship between baseline WMH volume and baseline MCH. 2) To assess the relationship between longitudinal WMH accumulation and last MRI MCH during the double-blind phase of the A4 trial. DESIGN: A multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 3 study comparing solanezumab with placebo given as infusions once every 4 weeks over 4.5 years in subjects with preclinical AD, defined as having evidence of elevated brain amyloid before the stage of clinically evident cognitive impairment, with an optional open-label extension period. SETTING: Anti-Amyloid Treatment in Asymptomatic Alzheimer's Disease (A4) study. PARTICIPANTS: A sample of 1157 cognitively unimpaired older adults (mean age = 71.9 years [SD = 4.8 years], 59% women, 59% APOE ε4 carriers). MEASUREMENTS: A linear regression model was used to assess the impact of baseline MCH amount (0, 1, 2+) on WMH volume. A linear mixed-effects model was used to assess the impact of last MRI MCH on longitudinal WMH. All models were corrected for age, sex, grey matter volume, cortical amyloid PET, APOE ε4 status, and treatment group. RESULTS: Baseline WMH volume was greater in individuals with more than one MCH compared to those with no MCH (t=4.8, p<0.001). The longitudinal increase in WMH amongst individuals with one (t=2.3, p=0.025) and more than one MCH (t=6.7, p<0.001) at the last MRI was greater than those with no MCH. CONCLUSION: These results indicate a strong association between WMH and MCH, a common manifestation of cerebral amyloid angiopathy and ARIA-H. These results suggest that increased WMH volume may represent an early sign of vessel amyloidosis, likely prior to the emergence of MCH.

Longitudinal Trajectories of the Cognitive Function Index in the A4 Study.	BACKGROUND: The Anti-Amyloid in Asymptomatic Alzheimer's Disease (A4) Study failed to show a treatment benefit with solanezumab, but the longitudinal consequences of elevated amyloid were observed in study participants with objective decline on the Preclinical Alzheimer Cognitive Composite (PACC) and subjective decline on the combined Cognitive Function Index (participant + study partner CFI), during the trial period. OBJECTIVES: We sought to expand on previous findings by comparing longitudinal patterns of participant and study partner CFI separately and their associations with the PACC stratified by baseline amyloid tertile over the course of the A4 Study. DESIGN: Cognitively unimpaired older adult participants and their study partners were independently administered the CFI at screen prior to amyloid PET disclosure and then at 3 subsequent visits (week 48, week 168, week 240) of the study. PACC collected at visits concurrent with CFI administration were also examined longitudinally. SETTING: The A4 Study was conducted at 67 sites in Australia, Canada, Japan, and the United States. PARTICIPANTS: 1,147 participants with elevated amyloid based on florbetapir PET were enrolled in the A4 Study and included in these analyses. 583 were on placebo and 564 were treated with solanezumab. MEASUREMENTS: The PACC was used to assess objective cognitive performance and the CFI was used to assess change in everyday cognitive functioning by the participant and their study partner independently. Amyloid level was characterized by Centiloid tertiles (<46.1 CL, 46.1 to 77.2 CL, >77.2 CL). Participants were aware of their elevated amyloid status, but not their CL tertile, or specific level of amyloid. Longitudinal correlations between participant and study partner CFI and PACC were examined at all visits where assessments were available. The impact of baseline amyloid tertile on CFI and PACC associations was also examined. RESULTS: Both participant and study partner CFI increased over the duration of the study indicating worsening cognitive functioning. Results did not differ by treatment group. The association between higher CFI and worse PACC for both for participant and study partner became progressively stronger over the course of the study. PACC had a significantly higher correlation with study partner CFI than with participant CFI by week 168. The stronger correlations between study partner CFI and PACC were driven by those in the highest amyloid tertile. CONCLUSION: Both participant and study partner report captured subtle changes in everyday cognitive functioning for participants with biomarker confirmed and disclosed preclinical AD. Moreover, study partner report was most highly aligned with cognitive decline, particularly among those with the highest amyloid load.

Medial amygdalar tau is associated with anxiety symptoms in preclinical Alzheimer's disease.	BACKGROUND: While the amygdala receives early tau deposition in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and is involved in social and emotional processing, the relationship between amygdalar tau and early neuropsychiatric symptoms in AD is unknown. We sought to determine whether focal tau binding in the amygdala and abnormal amygdalar connectivity were detectable in a preclinical AD cohort and identify relationships between these and self-reported mood symptoms. METHODS: We examined n=598 individuals (n=347 amyloid-positive (58% female), n=251 amyloid-negative (62% female); subset into tau PET and fMRI cohorts) from the A4 Study. In our tau PET cohort, we used amygdalar segmentations to examine representative nuclei from three functional divisions of the amygdala. We analyzed between-group differences in division-specific tau binding in the amygdala in preclinical AD. We conducted seed-based functional connectivity analyses from each division in the fMRI cohort. Finally, we conducted exploratory post-hoc correlation analyses between neuroimaging biomarkers of interest and anxiety and depression scores. RESULTS: Amyloid-positive individuals demonstrated increased tau binding in medial and lateral amygdala ( CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that preclinical tau deposition in the amygdala may result in meaningful changes in functional connectivity which may predispose patients to mood symptoms.	amygdala; anxiety; default mode network; functional networks; preclinical Alzheimer’s disease; tau

Preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD), characterized by the abnormal accumulation of amyloid prior to cognitive symptoms, presents a critical opportunity for early intervention. Past work has described functional connectivity changes in preclinical disease, yet the interplay between AD pathology and the functional connectome during this window remains unexplored. We applied connectome-based predictive modeling to investigate the ability of resting-state whole-brain functional connectivity to predict tau (18F-flortaucipir) and amyloid (18F-florbetapir) PET binding in a preclinical AD cohort (A4,

Sex differences in the association between tau PET and cognitive performance in a non-Hispanic White cohort with preclinical AD.	INTRODUCTION: We investigated how the associations between tau and cognitive measures differ by sex in the preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD) stage. METHODS: A total of 343 cognitively unimpaired, amyloid-positive individuals (205 women, 138 men) who self-identified as non-Hispanic White from the Anti-Amyloid Treatment in Asymptomatic Alzheimer's (A4) Study were included. We assessed sex-stratified associations between RESULTS: We observed that higher tau level was significantly associated with worse cognitive performance only in women: PACC and its components except for Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and C3 components: First Letter Name Recall (FNLT) and One-Card Learning Reaction Time (OCL RT). These associations except for FNLT were apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 independent. DISCUSSION: Women show stronger associations between tau PET and cognitive outcomes in preclinical AD. These findings have important implications for sex-specific tau-targeted preventive AD clinical trials. HIGHLIGHTS: The tau positron emission tomography (PET) signal in the meta-temporal region was associated with poor cognitive performance in preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD). After sex stratification, the associations between regional tau PET and cognitive outcomes were observed only in women. The associations between tau PET and some cognitive outcomes were independent of apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4.	APOE ε4; Alzheimer's disease; C3; PACC; cognition; sex differences; tau PET

Sex Differences in the Associations of Obesity with Tau, Amyloid PET, and Cognitive Outcomes in Preclinical Alzheimer's Disease: Cross-Sectional A4 Study.	BACKGROUND: The association between obesity and Alzheimer's disease (AD) is complex. Recent studies indicated the relationships between obesity and AD may differ by sex, and women may benefit from being overweight in terms of AD risk. OBJECTIVE: We investigated whether sex modifies the associations of obesity with tau positron emission tomography (PET), amyloid PET, and cognition in preclinical AD. METHODS: We included 387 cognitively-unimpaired amyloid-positive participants (221 women, 166 men, 87.6% non-Hispanic White) with available 18F-flortaucipir PET, 18F-florbetapir PET, and completed the Preclinical Alzheimer Cognitive Composite (PACC) tests from the Anti-Amyloid Treatment in Asymptomatic Alzheimer's Disease (A4) study. Participants were categorized based on body mass index (BMI: kg/m2): normal-weight (BMI: 18.5-25), overweight (BMI: 25-30), and obese (BMI≥30). RESULTS: Significant sex by BMI category interactions on PACC and its components: Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Reminding Test-Free+Total Recall (FCSRT96) revealed that overweight and obese women outperformed normal-weight women on FCSRT96, while obese men showed poorer MMSE performance than normal-weight men. These interactions were independent of APOE4. There were no significant interactions of sex by BMI category on tau and amyloid PET. However, sex-stratified analyses observed obesity was associated with less regional tau and mean cortical amyloid in women, not in men. CONCLUSION: This study found that in preclinical AD, overweight and obesity were associated with better verbal memory in women, whereas obesity was associated with worse global cognition among men. Future studies focusing on the mechanism for this relationship may inform sex-specific interventions for AD prevention.	Alzheimer’s disease; cognition; obesity; overweight; sex differences

Heterogeneity in Preclinical Alzheimer's Disease Trial Cohort Identified by Image-based Data-Driven Disease Progression Modelling.	IMPORTANCE: Undetected biological heterogeneity adversely impacts trials in Alzheimer's disease because rate of cognitive decline - and perhaps response to treatment - differs in subgroups. Recent results show that data-driven approaches can unravel the heterogeneity of Alzheimer's disease progression. The resulting stratification is yet to be leveraged in clinical trials. OBJECTIVE: Investigate whether image-based data-driven disease progression modelling could identify baseline biological heterogeneity in a clinical trial, and whether these subgroups have prognostic or predictive value. DESIGN: Screening data from the Anti-Amyloid Treatment in Asymptomatic Alzheimer Disease (A4) Study collected between April 2014 and December 2017, and longitudinal data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) observational study downloaded in February 2022 were used. SETTING: The A4 Study is an interventional trial involving 67 sites in the US, Canada, Australia, and Japan. ADNI is a multi-center observational study in North America. PARTICIPANTS: Cognitively unimpaired amyloid-positive participants with a 3-Tesla T1-weighted MRI scan. Amyloid positivity was determined using florbetapir PET imaging (in A4) and CSF Aβ(1-42) (in ADNI). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Regional volumes estimated from MRI scans were used as input to the Subtype and Stage Inference (SuStaIn) algorithm. Outcomes included cognitive test scores and SUVr values from florbetapir and flortaucipir PET. RESULTS: We included 1,240 Aβ+ participants (and 407 Aβ- controls) from the A4 Study, and 731 A4-eligible ADNI participants. SuStaIn identified three neurodegeneration subtypes - CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In a large secondary prevention trial, our image-based model detected neurodegenerative heterogeneity predictive of cognitive heterogeneity. We argue that such a model is a valuable tool to be considered in future trial design to control for previously undetected variance.

Evaluation of Blood-Based Plasma Biomarkers as Potential Markers of Amyloid Burden in Preclinical Alzheimer's Disease.	BACKGROUND: Participant eligibility for the A4 Study was determined by amyloid PET imaging. Given the disadvantages of amyloid PET imaging in accessibility and cost, blood-based biomarkers may serve as a sufficient biomarker and more cost-effective screening tool for patient enrollment into preclinical AD trials. OBJECTIVE: To determine if a blood-based screening test can adequately identify amyloid burden in participants screened into a preclinical AD trial. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, 224 participants from the A4 Study received an amyloid PET scan (18Florbetapir) within 90 days of blood sample collection. Blood samples from all study participants were processed within 2 h after phlebotomy. Plasma amyloid measures were quantified by Shimazdu and C2 N Diagnostics using mass spectrometry-based platforms. A corresponding subset of blood samples (n = 100) was processed within 24 h after phlebotomy and analyzed by C2 N. RESULTS: Plasma Aβ42/Aβ40 demonstrated the highest association for Aβ accumulation in the brain with an AUC 0.76 (95%CI = 0.69, 0.82) at C2 N and 0.80 (95%CI = 0.75, 0.86) at Shimadzu. Blood samples processed to plasma within 2 h after phlebotomy provided a better prediction of amyloid PET status than blood samples processed within 24 h (AUC 0.80 versus 0.64; p < 0.001). Age, sex, and APOE ɛ4 carrier status did not the diagnostic performance of plasma Aβ42/Aβ40 to predict amyloid PET positivity in A4 Study participants. CONCLUSION: Plasma Aβ42/Aβ40 may serve as a potential biomarker for predicting elevated amyloid in the brain. Utilizing blood testing over PET imaging may improve screening efficiency into clinical trials.	A4; Alzheimer’s disease; PET; amyloid-β; biomarkers; clinical trial; mass spectrometry

APOE effects on regional tau in preclinical Alzheimer's disease.	BACKGROUND: APOE variants are strongly associated with abnormal amyloid aggregation and additional direct effects of APOE on tau aggregation are reported in animal and human cell models. The degree to which these effects are present in humans when individuals are clinically unimpaired (CU) but have abnormal amyloid (Aβ+) remains unclear. METHODS: We analyzed data from CU individuals in the Anti-Amyloid Treatment in Asymptomatic AD (A4) and Longitudinal Evaluation of Amyloid Risk and Neurodegeneration (LEARN) studies. Amyloid PET data were available for 4486 participants (3163 Aβ-, 1323 Aβ+) and tau PET data were available for a subset of 447 participants (55 Aβ-, 392 Aβ+). Linear models examined APOE (number of e2 and e4 alleles) associations with global amyloid and regional tau burden in medial temporal lobe (entorhinal, amygdala) and early neocortical regions (inferior temporal, inferior parietal, precuneus). Consistency of APOE4 effects on regional tau were examined in 220 Aβ + CU and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). RESULTS: APOE2 and APOE4 were associated with lower and higher amyloid positivity rates, respectively. Among Aβ+ CU, e2 and e4 were associated with reduced (-12 centiloids per allele) and greater (+15 centiloids per allele) continuous amyloid burden, respectively. APOE2 was associated with reduced regional tau in all regions (-0.05 to -0.09 SUVR per allele), whereas APOE4 was associated with greater regional tau (+0.02 to +0.07 SUVR per allele). APOE differences were confirmed by contrasting e3/e3 with e2/e3 and e3/e4. Mediation analyses among Aβ+ s showed that direct effects of e2 on regional tau were present in medial temporal lobe and early neocortical regions, beyond an indirect pathway mediated by continuous amyloid burden. For e4, direct effects on regional tau were only significant in medial temporal lobe. The magnitude of protective e2 effects on regional tau was consistent across brain regions, whereas detrimental e4 effects were greatest in medial temporal lobe. APOE4 patterns were confirmed in Aβ+ ADNI participants. CONCLUSIONS: APOE influences early regional tau PET burden, above and beyond effects related to cross-sectional amyloid PET burden. Therapeutic strategies targeting underlying mechanisms related to APOE may modify tau accumulation among Aβ+ individuals.

An unsupervised XAI framework for dementia detection with context enrichment.	Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods enhance the diagnostic efficiency of clinical decision support systems by making the predictions of a convolutional neural network's (CNN) on brain imaging more transparent and trustworthy. However, their clinical adoption is limited due to limited validation of the explanation quality. Our study introduces a framework that evaluates XAI methods by integrating neuroanatomical morphological features with CNN-generated relevance maps for disease classification. We trained a CNN using brain MRI scans from six cohorts: ADNI, AIBL, DELCODE, DESCRIBE, EDSD, and NIFD (N = 3253), including participants that were cognitively normal, with amnestic mild cognitive impairment, dementia due to Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal dementia. Clustering analysis benchmarked different explanation space configurations by using morphological features as proxy-ground truth. We implemented three post-hoc explanations methods: (i) by simplifying model decisions, (ii) explanation-by-example, and (iii) textual explanations. A qualitative evaluation by clinicians (N = 6) was performed to assess their clinical validity. Clustering performance improved in morphology enriched explanation spaces, improving both homogeneity and completeness of the clusters. Post hoc explanations by model simplification largely delineated converters and stable participants, while explanation-by-example presented possible cognition trajectories. Textual explanations gave rule-based summarization of pathological findings. Clinicians' qualitative evaluation highlighted challenges and opportunities of XAI for different clinical applications. Our study refines XAI explanation spaces and applies various approaches for generating explanations.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Investigating modifiable risk factors, such as diet, is crucial in understanding their effects on the relationship between Alzheimer's disease (AD)-related cognitive decline and related conditions. This study assesses whether dietary patterns moderate the relationship between symptoms of depression, anxiety, and cognitive function in older adults. Given that biological and psychosocial differences between sexes may influence dietary behaviours, mental health symptoms, and cognitive outcomes, conducting sex-stratified analyses will allow for identification of differential associations. METHOD: Cross-sectional data from cognitively unimpaired older adults (n = 1174, age ≥60 years) from the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle (AIBL) study were included. Participants completed the Cancer Council of Victoria food frequency questionnaire, provided depression and anxiety symptom data, and underwent neuropsychological testing. Composite scores for six cognitive domains were generated from individual test scores (episodic recall, recognition, executive function, language, attention processing, and the AIBL Preclinical Alzheimer Cognitive Composite (PACC)). Dietary pattern scores were calculated for the Mediterranean diet (MeDi), Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH), and Western diet. Moderation analysis explored interactions between dietary patterns, depression, anxiety, and cognitive performance. RESULTS: The MeDi was found to moderate the relationship between depressive symptoms and attention processing in males, where low to moderate MeDi adherence was linked to poorer attention with higher depressive symptoms. The Western diet moderated the relationship between anxiety and the AIBL PACC score in males, with high adherence to the Western diet associated with worse PACC performance in those with greater anxiety. No significant moderating effects were observed in females for the MeDi and Western diet, or in either sex for the DASH diet on the association of depression and anxiety with cognitive function. CONCLUSION: These findings also emphasise the importance of sex-specific approaches in research on symptoms of depression and anxiety, cognitive health, and diet. Our results highlight the need for further investigation into sex-specific pathways using longitudinal study designs and randomised controlled trials to establish causal relationships.

INTRODUCTION: Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods enhance the diagnostic efficiency of clinical decision support systems by making the predictions of a convolutional neural network's (CNN) on brain imaging more transparent and trustworthy. However, their clinical adoption is limited due to limited validation of the explanation quality. Our study introduces a framework that evaluates XAI methods by integrating neuroanatomical morphological features with CNN-generated relevance maps for disease classification. METHODS: We trained a CNN using brain MRI scans from six cohorts: ADNI, AIBL, DELCODE, DESCRIBE, EDSD, and NIFD (N=3253), including participants that were cognitively normal, with amnestic mild cognitive impairment, dementia due to Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal dementia. Clustering analysis benchmarked different explanation space configurations by using morphological features as proxy-ground truth. We implemented three post-hoc explanations methods: i) by simplifying model decisions, ii) explanation-by-example, and iii) textual explanations. A qualitative evaluation by clinicians (N=6) was performed to assess their clinical validity. RESULTS: Clustering performance improved in morphology enriched explanation spaces, improving both homogeneity and completeness of the clusters. Post hoc explanations by model simplification largely delineated converters and stable participants, while explanation- by-example presented possible cognition trajectories. Textual explanations gave rule-based summarization of pathological findings. Clinicians' qualitative evaluation highlighted challenges and opportunities of XAI for different clinical applications. CONCLUSION: Our study refines XAI explanation spaces and applies various approaches for generating explanations. Within the context of AI-based decision support system in dementia research we found the explanations methods to be promising towards enhancing diagnostic efficiency, backed up by the clinical assessments.

Alzheimer's disease neuropathology and longitudinal change in subjective cognitive complaints.	INTRODUCTION: Subjective cognitive complaints often precede declines in objective measures of cognitive performance. Associations of incipient Alzheimer's disease (AD) neuropathology with subjective cognitive complaints may be detectable earlier than associations with neuropsychological testing among cognitively normal individuals. METHODS: We examined the independent associations of positron emission tomography measures of amyloid beta and tau pathologies with longitudinal subjective complaints and memory among 91 cognitively normal Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging participants using linear mixed effects models. Subjective complaints and memory performance were assessed with the Cognitive Failures Questionnaire and the California Verbal Learning Test, respectively. RESULTS: Greater parahippocampal tau, independent of amyloid, was associated with higher subjective complaints (estimate = 0.25, standard error [SE] = 0.1, CONCLUSION: Subjective cognitive complaints may be a reflection of early cerebral tau pathology in cognitively normal individuals. HIGHLIGHTS: Greater parahippocampal tau was linked with higher subjective cognitive complaints.Entorhinal tau was associated with slower increases in cognitive complaints over time.Subjective complaints may reflect early amyloid and tau in cognitively normal adults.

The Inner Ear and Aging Brain: A Cross-Sectional Study of Vestibular Function and Morphometric Variations in the Entorhinal and Trans-Entorhinal Cortex.	PURPOSE: While the vestibular system is crucial for balance, posture, and stable vision, emerging evidence connects vestibular loss in older adults to spatial cognitive deficits. However, the specific neural pathways remain unclear. This study examines morphometric changes in the entorhinal cortex (ERC) and trans-entorhinal cortex (TEC), key regions in the vestibular spatial cognitive network, with vestibular function. METHODS: This cross-sectional study used T1-weighted MRI images and vestibular physiological data from 103 Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging participants (74 males and 29 females). Vestibular function was assessed through the cervical vestibular-evoked myogenic potential (cVEMP), ocular VEMP (oVEMP), and video head-impulse test (vHIT), examining both categorical presence/absence of responses and continuous measures (cVEMP amplitude, oVEMP amplitude, and VOR gain). Morphometric changes in the ERC and TEC were analyzed by examining surface expansions and contractions relative to average shapes. RESULTS: Reduced saccular function correlated with surface expansion in the left ERC's pro-rhinal, right ERC's intermediate caudal and superior regions, and right TEC's sulcal region. The decreased utricular function was associated with surface contraction in the left lateral TEC, left ERC's anterior sulcal and trans-entorhinal regions, and surface expansion in the lateral region of the left ERC. Reduced canal function showed surface contraction in the right ERC's pro-rhinal and lateral regions and the right TEC's posterior sulcal and trans-entorhinal regions. CONCLUSION: These findings highlight the intricate link between vestibular function and ERC/TEC morphology, emphasizing their role in spatial and cognitive abilities. Future research will assess if structural changes due to vestibular loss contribute to cognitive deficits in aging and Alzheimer's disease.

Loneliness and Biomarkers of Alzheimer's Disease, Axonal Damage, and Astrogliosis: A Coordinated Analysis of Two Longitudinal Cohorts.	OBJECTIVES: Loneliness is associated with an elevated risk of dementia. There is mixed evidence from imaging studies on whether loneliness is associated with neuropathology in dementia-free adults. This study tests whether loneliness is associated with plasma neurobiomarkers of amyloid (Aβ42/Aβ40), phosphorylated tau 181 (pTau181), neurofilament light chain (NfL), and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and imaging measures of amyloid and tau. METHODS: Participants were cognitively unimpaired older adults from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study on Aging (BLSA; N = 1,028 individuals and up to 2,277 neurobiomarker measurements; Baseline mean age = 66, SD = 15 years) and the UK Biobank (N = 1,263 individuals and up to 2,526 neurobiomarker measurements; Baseline mean age = 60, SD = 7 years). Single-item measures of loneliness and the Quanterix Single Molecule Array assays were used in both samples. In a subset of BLSA participants, positron emission tomography (PET) was used to assess cerebral amyloid burden (n = 220) and tau in the entorhinal cortex (n = 102). RESULTS: In both samples and meta-analyses, loneliness was unrelated to plasma measures of Aβ42/Aβ40, pTau181, NfL, and GFAP. Changes in loneliness were also unrelated to changes in the plasma neurobiomarkers, and no consistent evidence of moderation by age, sex, or APOE ε4 allele was found. Loneliness was also unrelated to PET-based measures of amyloid and tau. DISCUSSION: This study found no associations between loneliness and measures of Alzheimer's disease pathology, axonal damage, or astrogliosis.	Amyloid; GFAP; Lonely; NfL; Tau

Sex differences in the trajectories of plasma biomarkers, brain atrophy, and cognitive decline relative to amyloid onset.	INTRODUCTION: The factors that influence the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) after individuals become amyloid-positive are poorly understood. This study examines how sex influences the longitudinal trajectories of plasma AD and neurodegenerative biomarkers in the years following a person's estimated onset of amyloid-β. METHODS: Linear mixed-effects modeling investigated overall and sex-specific longitudinal trajectories of plasma biomarkers, brain volumes, and cognition relative to the estimated age of amyloid onset in a cohort of 78 amyloid-positive Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) participants (n = 45 male; follow-up time: 6.8 years [SD 3.31]). Amyloid status was ascertained with RESULTS: After amyloid onset, men displayed steeper increases in pTau181, pTau231, and neurofilament light (NfL) compared to women. In this same period, men demonstrated steeper declines in brain volume and cognitive performance. DISCUSSION: These findings suggest that sex influences the trajectory of AD pathology, neuronal injury, and symptom progression after individuals become amyloid-positive. HIGHLIGHTS: Steeper rates of increase in pTau and GFAP among amyloid-positive individuals. After amyloid onset, steeper increases in pTau and NfL concentrations in men than in women. Steeper declines in brain volume and cognition in men corroborate biomarker results.	Alzheimer's disease; brain volume loss; cognitive decline; longitudinal study; plasma biomarkers; sex differences

While immune function is known to play a mechanistic role in Alzheimer's disease (AD), whether immune proteins in peripheral circulation influence the rate of amyloid-β (Aβ) progression - a central feature of AD - remains unknown. In the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging, we quantified 942 immunological proteins in plasma and identified 32 (including CAT [catalase], CD36 [CD36 antigen], and KRT19 [keratin 19]) associated with rates of cortical Aβ accumulation measured with positron emission tomography (PET). Longitudinal changes in a subset of candidate proteins also predicted Aβ progression, and the mid- to late-life (20-year) trajectory of one protein, CAT, was associated with late-life Aβ-positive status in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study. Genetic variation that influenced plasma levels of CAT, CD36 and KRT19 predicted rates of Aβ accumulation, including causal relationships with Aβ PET levels identified with two-sample Mendelian randomization. In addition to associations with tau PET and plasma AD biomarker changes, as well as expression patterns in human microglia subtypes and neurovascular cells in AD brain tissue, we showed that 31 % of candidate proteins were related to mid-life (20-year) or late-life (8-year) dementia risk in ARIC. Our findings reveal plasma proteins associated with longitudinal Aβ accumulation, and identify specific peripheral immune mediators that may contribute to the progression of AD pathophysiology.

Alzheimer's and neurodegenerative disease biomarkers in blood predict brain atrophy and cognitive decline.	BACKGROUND: Although blood-based biomarkers have been identified as cost-effective and scalable alternatives to PET and CSF markers of neurodegenerative disease, little is known about how these biomarkers predict future brain atrophy and cognitive decline in cognitively unimpaired individuals. Using data from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA), we examined whether plasma biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology (amyloid-β [Aβ METHODS: Plasma biomarkers were measured using Quanterix SIMOA assays. Regional brain volumes were measured by 3T MRI, and a battery of neuropsychological tests assessed five cognitive domains. Linear mixed effects models adjusted for demographic factors, kidney function, and intracranial volume (MRI analyses) were completed to relate baseline plasma biomarkers to baseline and longitudinal brain volume and cognitive performance. RESULTS: Brain volume analyses included 622 participants (mean age ± SD: 70.9 ± 10.2) with an average of 3.3 MRI scans over 4.7 years. Cognitive performance analyses included 674 participants (mean age ± SD: 71.2 ± 10.0) with an average of 3.9 cognitive assessments over 5.7 years. Higher baseline pTau-181 was associated with steeper declines in total gray matter volume and steeper regional declines in several medial temporal regions, whereas higher baseline GFAP was associated with greater longitudinal increases in ventricular volume. Baseline Aβ CONCLUSIONS: Among cognitively unimpaired older adults, plasma biomarkers of AD pathology (pTau-181) and astrogliosis (GFAP), but not neuronal injury (NfL), serve as markers of future brain atrophy and cognitive decline.

Leveraging longitudinal diffusion MRI data to quantify differences in white matter microstructural decline in normal and abnormal aging.	INTRODUCTION: It is unclear how rates of white matter microstructural decline differ between normal aging and abnormal aging. METHODS: Diffusion MRI data from several well-established longitudinal cohorts of aging (Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative [ADNI], Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging [BLSA], Vanderbilt Memory & Aging Project [VMAP]) were free-water corrected and harmonized. This dataset included 1723 participants (age at baseline: 72.8 ± 8.87 years, 49.5% male) and 4605 imaging sessions (follow-up time: 2.97 ± 2.09 years, follow-up range: 1-13 years, mean number of visits: 4.42 ± 1.98). Differences in white matter microstructural decline in normal and abnormal agers was assessed. RESULTS: While we found a global decline in white matter in normal/abnormal aging, we found that several white matter tracts (e.g., cingulum bundle) were vulnerable to abnormal aging. CONCLUSIONS: There is a prevalent role of white matter microstructural decline in aging, and future large-scale studies in this area may further refine our understanding of the underlying neurodegenerative processes. HIGHLIGHTS: Longitudinal data were free-water corrected and harmonized.Global effects of white matter decline were seen in normal and abnormal aging.The free-water metric was most vulnerable to abnormal aging.Cingulum free-water was the most vulnerable to abnormal aging.	aging; diffusion MRI; free‐water; harmonization; white matter

The association between personality and plasma biomarkers of astrogliosis and neuronal injury.	Personality traits have been associated with the risk of dementia and Alzheimer's disease neuropathology, including amyloid and tau. This study examines whether personality traits are concurrently related to plasma glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), a marker of astrogliosis, and neurofilament light (NfL), a marker of neuronal injury. Cognitively unimpaired participants from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study on Aging (N = 786; age: 22-95) were assayed for plasma GFAP and NfL and completed the Revised NEO Personality Inventory, which measures 5 domains and 30 facets of personality. Neuroticism (particularly vulnerability to stress, anxiety, and depression) was associated with higher GFAP and NfL. Conscientiousness was associated with lower GFAP. Extraversion (particularly positive emotions, assertiveness, and activity) was related to lower GFAP and NfL. These associations were independent of demographic, behavioral, and health covariates and not moderated by age, sex, or apolipoprotein E genotype. The personality correlates of astrogliosis and neuronal injury tend to be similar, are found in individuals without cognitive impairment, and point to potential neurobiological underpinnings of the association between personality traits and neurodegenerative diseases.

Sensory impairment and beta-amyloid deposition in the Baltimore longitudinal study of aging.	INTRODUCTION: Beta-amyloid (Aβ) plaque deposition is a biomarker of preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD). Impairments in sensory function are associated with cognitive decline. We sought to investigate the relationship between PET-indicated Aβ deposition and sensory impairment. METHODS: Using data from 174 participants ≥55 years in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging, we analyzed associations between sensory impairments and Aβ deposition measured by PET and Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB) mean cortical distribution volume ratio (cDVR). RESULTS: The combinations of hearing and proprioceptive impairment and hearing, vision, and proprioceptive impairment, were positively correlated with cDVR (β DISCUSSION: Our findings suggest a relationship between multi-sensory impairment (notably proprioceptive impairment) and Aβ deposition, which could reflect sensory impairment as an indicator or potentially a risk factor for Aβ deposition.

MRI and fluid biomarkers reveal determinants of myelin and axonal loss with aging.	OBJECTIVE: White matter damage is a feature of Alzheimer's disease, yet little is known about how facets of the Alzheimer's disease process relate to key features of white matter structure. We examined the association of Alzheimer's disease (Aß METHODS: Among cognitively normal participants in the BLSA and GESTALT studies who received MRI measures of myelin content (defined by myelin water fraction [MWF]) and axonal density (defined by neurite density index [NDI]), we quantified plasma levels of Aβ RESULTS: In total, 119 participants received MWF imaging (age: 56 [SD 21]), of which 43 received NDI imaging (age: 50 [SD 18]). We found no relationship between plasma biomarkers and total brain myelin content. However, secondary analysis found higher GFAP was associated with lower MWF in the temporal lobes (ß = -0.13; P = 0.049). Further, higher levels of NfL (ß = -0.22; P = 0.009) and GFAP (ß = -0.29; P = 0.002) were associated with lower total brain axonal density. Secondary analyses found lower Aβ INTERPRETATION: Plasma biomarkers of neuronal injury and astrogliosis are associated with reduced axonal density and region-specific myelin content. Axonal loss and demyelination may co-occur with neurodegeneration and astrogliosis ahead of clinically meaningful cognitive decline.

Plasma proteins related to inflammatory diet predict future cognitive impairment.	Dysregulation of the immune system and dietary patterns that increase inflammation can increase the risk for cognitive decline, but the mechanisms by which inflammatory nutritional habits may affect the development of cognitive impairment in aging are not well understood. To determine whether plasma proteins linked to inflammatory diet predict future cognitive impairment, we applied high-throughput proteomic assays to plasma samples from a subset (n = 1528) of Women's Health Initiative Memory Study (WHIMS) participants (mean [SD] baseline age, 71.3 [SD 3.8] years). Results provide insights into how inflammatory nutritional patterns are associated with an immune-related proteome and identify a group of proteins (CXCL10, CCL3, HGF, OPG, CDCP1, NFATC3, ITGA11) related to future cognitive impairment over a 14-year follow-up period. Several of these inflammatory diet proteins were also associated with dementia risk across two external cohorts (ARIC, ESTHER), correlated with plasma biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology (Aβ

Although liver dysfunction has been implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD), it remains unknown how liver disease may influence the trajectory of brain and cognitive changes in older adults. We related self-reported liver disease to longitudinal measures of brain structure and cognition, as well as baseline measures of plasma AD/neurodegeneration biomarkers in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging. Liver disease was identified using ICD-9 classification codes. Brain volume and cognition were assessed serially using 3T-MRI and a cognitive battery. 1008, 2157, and 780 participants were included in the MRI, cognitive, and plasma biomarker analysis, respectively. After adjustment for confounders, liver disease was associated with accelerated decline in total brain and white matter volume, but not total gray matter or AD signature region volume. Although liver disease showed no relationship with domain-specific cognitive decline or plasma biomarkers, participants with a history of hepatitis demonstrated accelerated decline in verbal fluency and elevated neurofilament light. Results suggest all-cause liver disease may accelerate brain volume loss but does not appear to promote AD-specific neurocognitive changes.

BACKGROUND: Amyloid beta (Aβ), phosphorylated tau (p-tau), and total tau (t-tau) in cerebrospinal fluid are established biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease (AD). In other neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's disease (PD), these biomarkers have also been found to be altered, and the molecular mechanisms responsible for these alterations are still under investigation. Moreover, the interplay between these mechanisms and the diverse underlying disease states remains to be elucidated. OBJECTIVES: To investigate genetic contributions to the AD biomarkers and assess the commonality and heterogeneity of the associations per underlying disease status. METHODS: We conducted GWAS for the AD biomarkers on subjects from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI), the Fox Investigation for New Discovery of Biomarkers (BioFIND), and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and meta-analyzed with the largest AD GWAS.[7] We tested heterogeneity of associations of interest between different disease statuses (AD, PD, and control).

A short version of the Everyday Cognition scale can predict clinical progression and cognitive decline.	BACKGROUND: The Everyday Cognition scale (ECog-39) scores are associated with future cognitive decline. We investigated whether the 12-item ECog (ECog-12), which is being collected in Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI)4, can predict progression. METHODS: Baseline self (PT)- and study partner (SP)-ECog-12 data were extracted from the 39-item version collected in the ADNI. Weibull analysis examined the relationship between baseline ECog-12 and future clinical progression (change in Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes [CDR-SB] scores and diagnostic conversion). RESULTS: Higher PT- and SP-ECog-12 scores were associated with faster CDR-SB worsening, with hazard ratios in cognitively unimpaired (CU) 3.34 and 9.61, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) 1.44 and 2.82, and dementia 0.93 and 1.82. They were associated with conversion from CU to MCI 3.01 and 6.24 and MCI to dementia 1.61 and 3.07. DISCUSSION: SP-ECog-12 provided a higher prognostic value for predicting clinical progression, so this can help identify and monitor patients at risk in research and health-care settings. HIGHLIGHTS: The 12-item Everyday Cognition scale (ECog-12) data obtained from both raters increased diagnostic conversion risk from cognitively unimpaired to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and from MCI to dementia. ECog-12, rated by study partners, was associated with an increased risk of Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes worsening in all diagnostic groups. Our results provide novel information about the specific scoring outputs and rater types (participant vs. study partner) of ECog-12 that can facilitate screening, prioritization, and longitudinal monitoring of the clinical progression of participants in Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 4 and other Alzheimer's disease clinical studies, clinical trials, and in health-care settings.	12‐item Everyday Cognition; Alzheimer's disease; Everyday Cognition scale; dementia; mild cognitive impairment

Unsupervised Online Paired Associates Learning Task from the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB®) in the Brain Health Registry.	BACKGROUND: Unsupervised online cognitive assessments have demonstrated promise as an efficient and scalable approach for evaluating cognition in aging, and Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility, usability, and construct validity of the Paired Associates Learning task from the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery® in adults enrolled in the Brain Health Registry. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, MEASUREMENTS: The Paired Associates Learning task was administered to Brain Health Registry participants in a remote, unsupervised, online setting. In this cross-sectional analysis, we 1) evaluated construct validity by analyzing associations between Paired Associates Learning performance and additional participant registry data, including demographics, self- and study partner-reported subjective cognitive change (Everyday Cognition scale), self-reported memory concern, and depressive symptom severity (Patient Health Questionnaire-9) using multivariable linear regression models; 2) determined the predictive value of Paired Associates Learning and other registry variables for identifying participants who self-report Mild Cognitive Impairment by employing multivariable binomial logistic regressions and calculating the area under the receiver operator curve; 3) investigated feasibility by looking at task completion rates and statistically comparing characteristics of task completers and non-completers; and 4) evaluated usability in terms of participant requests for support from BHR related to the assessment. RESULTS: In terms of construct validity, in participants who took the Paired Associates Learning for the first time (N=14,528), worse performance was associated with being older, being male, lower educational attainment, higher levels of self- and study partner-reported decline, more self-reported memory concerns, greater depressive symptom severity, and self-report of Mild Cognitive Impairment. Paired Associates Learning performance and Brain Health Registry variables together identified those with self-reported Mild Cognitive Impairment with moderate accuracy (areas under the curve: 0.66-0.68). In terms of feasibility, in a sub-sample of 29,176 participants who had the opportunity to complete Paired Associates Learning for the first time in the registry, 14,417 started the task. 11,647 (80.9% of those who started) completed the task. Compared to those who did not complete the task at their first opportunity, those who completed were older, had more years of education, more likely to self-identify as White, less likely to self-identify as Latino, less likely to have a subjective memory concern, and more likely to report a family history of Alzheimer's disease. In terms of usability, out of 8,395 received requests for support from BHR staff via email, 4.4% (n=374) were related to PAL. Of those, 82% were related to technical difficulties. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support moderate feasibility, good usability, and construct validity of cross-sectional Paired Associates Learning in an unsupervised online registry, but also highlight the need to make the assessment more inclusive and accessible to individuals from ethnoculturally and socioeconomically diverse communities. A future, improved version could be a scalable, efficient method to assess cognition in many different settings, including clinical trials, observational studies, healthcare, and public health.

Remote blood collection from older adults in the Brain Health Registry for plasma biomarker and genetic analysis.	INTRODUCTION: Use of online registries to efficiently identify older adults with cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an approach with growing evidence for feasibility and validity. Linked biomarker and registry data can facilitate AD clinical research. METHODS: We collected blood for plasma biomarker and genetic analysis from older adult Brain Health Registry (BHR) participants, evaluated feasibility, and estimated associations between demographic variables and study participation. RESULTS: Of 7150 participants invited to the study, 864 (12%) enrolled and 629 (73%) completed remote blood draws. Participants reported high study acceptability. Those from underrepresented ethnocultural and educational groups were less likely to participate. DISCUSSION: This study demonstrates the challenges of remote blood collection from a large representative sample of older adults. Remote blood collection from > 600 participants within a short timeframe demonstrates the feasibility of our approach, which can be expanded for efficient collection of plasma AD biomarker and genetic data.

Accurate Detection of α-Synuclein Seeds in Cerebrospinal Fluid from Isolated Rapid Eye Movement Sleep Behavior Disorder and Patients with Parkinson's Disease in the DeNovo Parkinson (DeNoPa) Cohort.	BACKGROUND: Misfolded α-synuclein (αSyn) aggregates (αSyn-seeds) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) are biomarkers for synucleinopathies such as Parkinson's disease (PD). αSyn-seeds have been detected in prodromal cases with isolated rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (iRBD). OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to determine the accuracy of the αSyn-seed amplification assay (αS-SAA) in a comprehensively characterized cohort with a high proportion of PD and iRBD CSF samples collected at baseline. METHODS: We used a high-throughput αS-SAA to analyze 233 blinded CSF samples from 206 participants of the DeNovo Parkinson Cohort (DeNoPa) (113 de novo PD, 64 healthy controls, 29 iRBD confirmed by video polysomnography). Results were compared with the final diagnosis, which was determined after up to 10 years of longitudinal clinical evaluations, including dopamine-transporter-single-photon emission computed tomography (DAT-SPECT) at baseline, CSF proteins, Movement Disorder Society-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, and various cognitive and nonmotor scales. RESULTS: αS-SAA detected αSyn-seeds in baseline PD-CSF with 98% accuracy. αSyn-seeds were detected in 93% of the iRBD cases. αS-SAA results showed higher agreement with the final than the initial diagnosis, as 14 patients were rediagnosed as non-αSyn aggregation disorder. For synucleinopathies, αS-SAA showed higher concordance with the final diagnosis than DAT-SPECT. Statistically significant correlations were found between assay parameters and disease progression. CONCLUSIONS: Our results confirm αS-SAA accuracy at the first clinical evaluation when a definite diagnosis is most consequential. αS-SAA conditions reported here are highly sensitive, enabling the detection of αSyn-seeds in CSF from iRBD just months after the first symptoms, suggesting that αSyn-seeds are present in the very early prodromal phase of synucleinopathies. Therefore, αSyn-seeds are clear risk markers for synuclein-related disorders, but not for time of phenoconversion. © 2023 The Authors.

Decreased DTI-APLS correlated with cognitive impairment in veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder.	Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a risk for cognitive impairment with underlying mechanism unresolved. Our study aimed to evaluate the glymphatic function in veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and to explore associations between glymphatic function, sleep patterns, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers (Aβ, t-tau, p-tau), and cognitive impairment. In our study, we included 43 Vietnam War veterans with PTSD and 43 controls. Diffusion tensor image analysis along the perivascular space (DTI-ALPS) was calculated to reflect glymphatic function. Multiple linear regressions and mediation analyses were employed to examine the relationships between the clinician-administered PTSD scale (CAPS) scores, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), DTI-ALPS and cognitive impairment. Our study revealed that PTSD group exhibited lower DTI-ALPS (p = 0.001), higher CAPS (p < 0.001), higher PSQI (p < 0.001), and poorer cognitive performance in CDR-SoB (p = 0.019) and ADAS-Cog total 13 (p = 0.009). CAPS was significantly associated with DTI-ALPS (β = -0.0018, 95% CI: -0.0029, -0.0006, p = 0.0028). PSQI demonstrated an indirect effect (β = -0.0005, 95% CI: -0.0011, -0.0001) and mediated 21.74% effect for the relationship between CAPS and DTI-ALPS. CAPS was significantly associated with CDR-SoB and ADAS-Cog total 13 (β = 0.0067, 95% CI: 0.00087, 0.0124, p = 0.024; β = 0.058, 95% CI: 0.013, 0.103, p = 0.012). DTI-ALPS had an indirect effect (β = 0.0024, 95% CI: 0.0006, 0.0069) and mediated all effect for the relationship between CAPS and CDR-SoB. In conclusion, glymphatic system was impaired in PTSD veterans revealed by DTI-ALPS, and poor sleep quality partially mediated the relationship between PTSD severity and impaired glymphatic function. DTI-ALPS mediated the relationship between PTSD severity and cognitive impairment.	Cognitive impairment; DTI-ALPS; Glymphatic system; Post-traumatic stress disorder; Sleep

Autophagy activators normalize aberrant Tau proteostasis and rescue synapses in human familial Alzheimer's disease iPSC-derived cortical organoids.	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia worldwide. Despite extensive progress, the cellular and molecular mechanisms of AD remain incompletely understood, partially due to inadequate disease models. To illuminate the earliest changes in hereditary (familial) Alzheimer's disease, we developed an isogenic AD cerebrocortical organoid (CO) model. Our refined methodology produces COs containing excitatory and inhibitory neurons alongside glial cells, utilizing established isogenic wild-type and diseased human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) carrying heterozygous familial AD mutations, namely PSEN1	Alzheimer’s disease; Amyloid Beta Precursor Protein; Autophagy; Cortical organoids; Presenilin 1; Tau; chronic treatment; human model; iPSC-derived; oligomers; pTau

Synaptic protein CSF levels relate to memory scores in individuals without dementia.	BACKGROUND: We investigated how cerebrospinal fluid levels of synaptic proteins associate with memory function in normal cognition (CN) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and investigated the effect of amyloid positivity on these associations. METHODS: We included 242 CN (105(43%) abnormal amyloid), and 278 MCI individuals (183(66%) abnormal amyloid) from the European Medical Information Framework for Alzheimer's Disease Multimodal Biomarker Discovery (EMIF-AD MBD) and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). For 181 (EMIF-AD MBD) and 36 (ADNI) proteins with a synaptic annotation in SynGO, associations with word learning recall were analysed with linear models. RESULTS: Subsets of synaptic proteins showed lower levels with worse recall in preclinical AD (EMIF-AD MBD: 7, ADNI: 5 proteins, none overlapping), prodromal AD (EMIF-AD MBD only, 27 proteins) and non-AD MCI (EMIF-AD MBD: 1, ADNI: 7 proteins). The majority of these associations were specific to these clinical groups. CONCLUSIONS: Synaptic disturbance-related memory impairment occurred very early in AD, indicating it may be relevant to develop therapies targeting the synapse early in the disease.

Identifying pathways to the prevention of dementia: the Netherlands consortium of dementia cohorts.	BACKGROUND: Aggregation of cohort data increases precision for studying neurodegenerative disease pathways, but efforts to combine data and expertise are often hampered by infrastructural, ethical and legal considerations. We aimed to unite various cohort studies in the Netherlands to enhance research infrastructure and facilitate research on dementia etiology and its public health implications. METHODS: The Netherlands Consortium of Dementia Cohorts (NCDC) includes participants with initially no established cognitive impairment from 9 Dutch cohorts: the Amsterdam Dementia Cohort (ADC), Doetinchem Cohort Study (DCS), European Medical Information Framework for Alzheimer's Disease (EMIF-AD), Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam (LASA), the Leiden Longevity Study (LLS), The Maastricht Study, the Memolife substudy of the Lifelines cohort, Rotterdam Study and Second Manifestations of ARTerial disease-Magnetic Resonance (SMART-MR) study. The objectives of NCDC are to improve data infrastructure and access to cohorts related to aging and dementia, investigate the role of Alzheimer's disease and vascular pathology in the development of dementia and estimate the public health impact of established dementia risk factors by assessing their relative contribution to the population burden of dementia. RESULTS: We increased the findability, accessibility, interoperability and reusability (FAIR) status of the cohorts through harmonization of data across cohorts, implementation of medical imaging repositories for scan management, implementation of the Personal Health Train infrastructure and provision of meta-data in existing cohort catalogues. We established the ethical and legal frameworks required for federated and pooled analyses and performed the first remote federated data analyses using the Personal Health Train infrastructure. To determine biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease, endothelial dysfunction and inflammation, 2554 plasma samples were analyzed centrally. Federated, pooled, and coordinated meta-analyses have led to multiple publications in the context of NCDC. CONCLUSION: The combination of population-based and clinical cohorts, the coordinated assessment of plasma markers in previously collected samples and implementation and use of the Personal Health Train infrastructure for federated analysis are both feasible and promising for future collaborative efforts.

Blood DNA methylomic signatures associated with CSF biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease in the EMIF-AD study.	INTRODUCTION: We investigated blood DNA methylation patterns associated with 15 well-established cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathophysiology, neuroinflammation, and neurodegeneration. METHODS: We assessed DNA methylation in 885 blood samples from the European Medical Information Framework for Alzheimer's Disease (EMIF-AD) study using the EPIC array. RESULTS: We identified Bonferroni-significant differential methylation associated with CSF YKL-40 (five loci) and neurofilament light chain (NfL; seven loci) levels, with two of the loci associated with CSF YKL-40 levels correlating with plasma YKL-40 levels. A co-localization analysis showed shared genetic variants underlying YKL-40 DNA methylation and CSF protein levels, with evidence that DNA methylation mediates the association between genotype and protein levels. Weighted gene correlation network analysis identified two modules of co-methylated loci correlated with several amyloid measures and enriched in pathways associated with lipoproteins and development. DISCUSSION: We conducted the most comprehensive epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) of AD-relevant CSF biomarkers to date. Future work should explore the relationship between YKL-40 genotype, DNA methylation, and protein levels in the brain. HIGHLIGHTS: Blood DNA methylation was assessed in the EMIF-AD MBD study. Epigenome-wide association studies (EWASs) were performed for 15 Alzheimer's disease (AD)-relevant cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker measures. Five Bonferroni-significant loci were associated with YKL-40 levels and seven with neurofilament light chain (NfL). DNA methylation in YKL-40 co-localized with previously reported genetic variation. DNA methylation potentially mediates the effect of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in YKL-40 on CSF protein levels.

CSF proteomic profiles of neurodegeneration biomarkers in Alzheimer's disease.	INTRODUCTION: We aimed to unravel the underlying pathophysiology of the neurodegeneration (N) markers neurogranin (Ng), neurofilament light (NfL), and hippocampal volume (HCV), in Alzheimer's disease (AD) using cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteomics. METHODS: Individuals without dementia were classified as A+ (CSF amyloid beta [Aβ]42), T+ (CSF phosphorylated tau181), and N+ or N- based on Ng, NfL, or HCV separately. CSF proteomics were generated and compared between groups using analysis of covariance. RESULTS: Only a few individuals were A+T+Ng-. A+T+Ng+ and A+T+NfL+ showed different proteomic profiles compared to A+T+Ng- and A+T+NfL-, respectively. Both Ng+ and NfL+ were associated with neuroplasticity, though in opposite directions. Compared to A+T+HCV-, A+T+HCV+ showed few proteomic changes, associated with oxidative stress. DISCUSSION: Different N markers are associated with distinct neurodegenerative processes and should not be equated. N markers may differentially complement disease staging beyond amyloid and tau. Our findings suggest that Ng may not be an optimal N marker, given its low incongruency with tau pathophysiology. HIGHLIGHTS: In Alzheimer's disease, neurogranin (Ng)+, neurofilament light (NfL)+, and hippocampal volume (HCV)+ showed differential protein expression in cerebrospinal fluid. Ng+ and NfL+ were associated with neuroplasticity, although in opposite directions. HCV+ showed few proteomic changes, related to oxidative stress. Neurodegeneration (N) markers may differentially refine disease staging beyond amyloid and tau. Ng might not be an optimal N marker, as it relates more closely to tau.

Multivariate GWAS of Alzheimer's disease CSF biomarker profiles implies GRIN2D in synaptic functioning.	BACKGROUND: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of Alzheimer's disease (AD) have identified several risk loci, but many remain unknown. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers may aid in gene discovery and we previously demonstrated that six CSF biomarkers (β-amyloid, total/phosphorylated tau, NfL, YKL-40, and neurogranin) cluster into five principal components (PC), each representing statistically independent biological processes. Here, we aimed to (1) identify common genetic variants associated with these CSF profiles, (2) assess the role of associated variants in AD pathophysiology, and (3) explore potential sex differences. METHODS: We performed GWAS for each of the five biomarker PCs in two multi-center studies (EMIF-AD and ADNI). In total, 973 participants (n = 205 controls, n = 546 mild cognitive impairment, n = 222 AD) were analyzed for 7,433,949 common SNPs and 19,511 protein-coding genes. Structural equation models tested whether biomarker PCs mediate genetic risk effects on AD, and stratified and interaction models probed for sex-specific effects. RESULTS: Five loci showed genome-wide significant association with CSF profiles, two were novel (rs145791381 [inflammation] and GRIN2D [synaptic functioning]) and three were previously described (APOE, TMEM106B, and CHI3L1). Follow-up analyses of the two novel signals in independent datasets only supported the GRIN2D locus, which contains several functionally interesting candidate genes. Mediation tests indicated that variants in APOE are associated with AD status via processes related to amyloid and tau pathology, while markers in TMEM106B and CHI3L1 are associated with AD only via neuronal injury/inflammation. Additionally, seven loci showed sex-specific associations with AD biomarkers. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that pathway and sex-specific analyses can improve our understanding of AD genetics and may contribute to precision medicine.

A microglial activity state biomarker panel differentiates FTD-granulin and Alzheimer's disease patients from controls.	BACKGROUND: With the emergence of microglia-modulating therapies there is an urgent need for reliable biomarkers to evaluate microglial activation states. METHODS: Using mouse models and human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived microglia (hiMGL), genetically modified to yield the most opposite homeostatic (TREM2-knockout) and disease-associated (GRN-knockout) states, we identified microglia activity-dependent markers. Non-targeted mass spectrometry was used to identify proteomic changes in microglia and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of Grn- and Trem2-knockout mice. Additionally, we analyzed the proteome of GRN- and TREM2-knockout hiMGL and their conditioned media. Candidate marker proteins were tested in two independent patient cohorts, the ALLFTD cohort (GRN mutation carriers versus non-carriers), as well as the proteomic data set available from the EMIF-AD MBD study. RESULTS: We identified proteomic changes between the opposite activation states in mouse microglia and CSF, as well as in hiMGL cell lysates and conditioned media. For further verification, we analyzed the CSF proteome of heterozygous GRN mutation carriers suffering from frontotemporal dementia (FTD). We identified a panel of six proteins (FABP3, MDH1, GDI1, CAPG, CD44, GPNMB) as potential indicators for microglial activation. Moreover, we confirmed three of these proteins (FABP3, GDI1, MDH1) to be significantly elevated in the CSF of Alzheimer's (AD) patients. Remarkably, each of these markers differentiated amyloid-positive cases with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) from amyloid-negative individuals. CONCLUSIONS: The identified candidate proteins reflect microglia activity and may be relevant for monitoring the microglial response in clinical practice and clinical trials modulating microglial activity and amyloid deposition. Moreover, the finding that three of these markers differentiate amyloid-positive from amyloid-negative MCI cases in the AD cohort suggests that these proteins associate with a very early immune response to seeded amyloid. This is consistent with our previous findings in the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer's Disease Network (DIAN) cohort, where soluble TREM2 increases as early as 21 years before symptom onset. Moreover, in mouse models for amyloidogenesis, seeding of amyloid is limited by physiologically active microglia further supporting their early protective role. The biological functions of some of our main candidates (FABP3, CD44, GPNMB) also further emphasize that lipid dysmetabolism may be a common feature of neurodegenerative disorders.

Protein disulfide isomerases as CSF biomarkers for the neuronal response to tau pathology.	INTRODUCTION: Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers for specific cellular disease processes are lacking for tauopathies. In this translational study we aimed to identify CSF biomarkers reflecting early tau pathology-associated unfolded protein response (UPR) activation. METHODS: We employed mass spectrometry proteomics and targeted immunoanalysis in a combination of biomarker discovery in primary mouse neurons in vitro and validation in patient CSF from two independent large multicentre cohorts (EMIF-AD MBD, n = 310; PRIDE, n = 771). RESULTS: First, we identify members of the protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) family in the neuronal UPR-activated secretome and validate secretion upon tau aggregation in vitro. Next, we demonstrate that PDIA1 and PDIA3 levels correlate with total- and phosphorylated-tau levels in CSF. PDIA1 levels are increased in CSF from AD patients compared to controls and patients with tau-unrelated frontotemporal and Lewy body dementia (LBD). HIGHLIGHTS: Neuronal unfolded protein response (UPR) activation induces the secretion of protein disulfide isomerases (PDIs) in vitro. PDIA1 is secreted upon tau aggregation in neurons in vitro. PDIA1 and PDIA3 levels correlate with total and phosphorylated tau levels in CSF. PDIA1 levels are increased in CSF from Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients compared to controls. PDIA1 levels are not increased in CSF from tau-unrelated frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and Lewy body dementia (LBD) patients.	Alzheimer's disease; CSF biomarker; PDI; UPR; tau pathology

Multiomics profiling of human plasma and cerebrospinal fluid reveals ATN-derived networks and highlights causal links in Alzheimer's disease.	INTRODUCTION: This study employed an integrative system and causal inference approach to explore molecular signatures in blood and CSF, the amyloid/tau/neurodegeneration [AT(N)] framework, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) conversion to Alzheimer's disease (AD), and genetic risk for AD. METHODS: Using the European Medical Information Framework (EMIF)-AD cohort, we measured 696 proteins in cerebrospinal fluid (n = 371), 4001 proteins in plasma (n = 972), 611 metabolites in plasma (n = 696), and genotyped whole-blood (7,778,465 autosomal single nucleotide epolymorphisms, n = 936). We investigated associations: molecular modules to AT(N), module hubs with AD Polygenic Risk scores and APOE4 genotypes, molecular hubs to MCI conversion and probed for causality with AD using Mendelian randomization (MR). RESULTS: AT(N) framework associated with protein and lipid hubs. In plasma, Proprotein Convertase Subtilisin/Kexin Type 7 showed evidence for causal associations with AD. AD was causally associated with Reticulocalbin 2 and sphingomyelins, an association driven by the APOE isoform. DISCUSSION: This study reveals multi-omics networks associated with AT(N) and causal AD molecular candidates.

Distinct disease mechanisms may underlie cognitive decline related to hearing loss in different age groups.	BACKGROUND: Hearing loss in older adults is associated with increased dementia risk. Underlying mechanisms that connect hearing loss with dementia remain largely unclear. METHODS: We studied the association of hearing loss and biomarkers for dementia risk in two age groups with normal cognition: 65 participants from the European Medical Information Framework (EMIF)-Alzheimer's disease (AD) 90+ study (oldest-old; mean age 92.7 years, 56.9% female) and 60 participants from the EMIF-AD PreclinAD study (younger-old; mean age 74.4, 43.3% female). Hearing function was tested by the 'digits-in-noise test' and cognition by repeated neuropsychological evaluation. Regressions and generalised estimating equations were used to test the association of hearing function and PET-derived amyloid burden, and linear mixed models were used to test the association of hearing function and cognitive decline. In the oldest-old group, mediation analyses were performed to study whether cognitive decline is mediated through regional brain atrophy. RESULTS: In oldest-old individuals, hearing function was not associated with amyloid pathology (p=0.7), whereas in the younger-old individuals hearing loss was associated with higher amyloid burden (p=0.0034). In oldest-old individuals, poorer hearing was associated with a steeper decline in memory, global cognition and language, and in the younger-old with steeper decline in language only. The hippocampus and nucleus accumbens mediated the effects of hearing loss on memory and global cognition in the oldest-old individuals. CONCLUSIONS: Hearing loss was associated with amyloid binding in younger-old individuals only, and with cognitive decline in both age groups. These results suggest that mechanisms linking hearing loss with risk for dementia depends on age.	ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE; AMYLOID; COGNITION; DEMENTIA

Predicting AT(N) pathologies in Alzheimer's disease from blood-based proteomic data using neural networks.	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Blood-based biomarkers represent a promising approach to help identify early Alzheimer's disease (AD). Previous research has applied traditional machine learning (ML) to analyze plasma omics data and search for potential biomarkers, but the most modern ML methods based on deep learning has however been scarcely explored. In the current study, we aim to harness the power of state-of-the-art deep learning neural networks (NNs) to identify plasma proteins that predict amyloid, tau, and neurodegeneration (AT[N]) pathologies in AD. METHODS: We measured 3,635 proteins using SOMAscan in 881 participants from the European Medical Information Framework for AD Multimodal Biomarker Discovery study (EMIF-AD MBD). Participants underwent measurements of brain amyloid β (Aβ) burden, phosphorylated tau (p-tau) burden, and total tau (t-tau) burden to determine their AT(N) statuses. We ranked proteins by their association with Aβ, p-tau, t-tau, and AT(N), and fed the top 100 proteins along with age and apolipoprotein E ( RESULTS: Age and CONCLUSION: Combined with age and	Alzheimer’s disease; amyloid β; artificial neural networks; machine learning; neurodegeneration; plasma proteomics; tau

Whole-exome rare-variant analysis of Alzheimer's disease and related biomarker traits.	INTRODUCTION: Despite increasing evidence of a role of rare genetic variation in the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD), limited attention has been paid to its contribution to AD-related biomarker traits indicative of AD-relevant pathophysiological processes. METHODS: We performed whole-exome gene-based rare-variant association studies (RVASs) of 17 AD-related traits on whole-exome sequencing (WES) data generated in the European Medical Information Framework for Alzheimer's Disease Multimodal Biomarker Discovery (EMIF-AD MBD) study (n = 450) and whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data from ADNI (n = 808). RESULTS: Mutation screening revealed a novel probably pathogenic mutation (PSEN1 p.Leu232Phe). Gene-based RVAS revealed the exome-wide significant contribution of rare coding variation in RBKS and OR7A10 to cognitive performance and protection against left hippocampal atrophy, respectively. DISCUSSION: The identification of these novel gene-trait associations offers new perspectives into the role of rare coding variation in the distinct pathophysiological processes culminating in AD, which may lead to identification of novel therapeutic and diagnostic targets.

Redefining ALS: Large-scale proteomic profiling reveals a prolonged pre-diagnostic phase with immune, muscular, metabolic, and brain involvement.	BACKGROUND: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder with a largely unknown duration and pathophysiology of the pre-diagnostic phase, especially for the common non-monogenic form. METHODS: We leveraged the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) cohort with up to 30 years of follow-up to identify incident ALS cases across five European countries. Pre-diagnostic plasma samples from initially healthy participants underwent high-throughput proteomic profiling (7,285 protein markers, SomaScan). Cox proportional hazards models based on 4,567 participants (including 172 incident ALS cases) were used to identify protein biomarkers associated with future ALS diagnosis. Top results were indirectly validated in two independent case-control studies of prevalent ALS (n=417 ALS, 852 controls). Functional annotation included cross-disease comparisons, gene set and tissue enrichment testing, organ-specific proteomic clocks, and the application of large-language models (LLM). FINDINGS: Five proteins (SECTM1, CA3, THAP4, KLHL41, SLC26A7) were identified as significant pre-diagnostic ALS biomarkers (FDR=0.05), detectable approximately two decades before diagnosis. Of these, all except SECTM1 were indirectly validated in independent cohorts of prevalent ALS cases, supporting their clinical significance. Additionally, 22 nominally significant (p<0.05) pre-diagnostic biomarkers were FDR-significant in prevalent ALS with consistent effect directions. Cross-disease comparisons with pre-diagnostic Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease suggested a largely specific pre-diagnostic ALS biomarker signature. Gene ontology and tissue enrichment highlighted early involvement of immune, muscle, metabolic, and digestive processes. Furthermore, analyses of proteomic clocks revealed accelerated aging in brain-cognition, immune, and muscle tissues before clinical diagnosis. Druggability and LLM analyses revealed possible therapeutic targets and novel strategies, emphasizing translational relevance. INTERPRETATION: Our study provides first evidence of ultra-early molecular changes in common ALS up to two decades prior to clinical onset, mainly affecting immune, muscle, metabolic, digestive, and cognitive systems. Our study nominates several compelling candidates for risk stratification studies and novel therapeutic targets for early intervention.

Protein-based Diagnosis and Analysis of Co-pathologies Across Neurodegenerative Diseases: Large-Scale AI-Boosted CSF and Plasma Classification.	Neurodegenerative diseases (including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Frontotemporal dementia, and Dementia with Lewy bodies) pose diagnostic challenges due to overlapping pathology and clinical heterogeneity. We leveraged proteomic data from more than 21,000 cerebrospinal fluid and plasma samples to develop and validate explainable, boosting-based multi-disease AI classifiers. The models achieved weighted AUCs in the testing datasets of 0.97 for CSF and 0.88 for plasma, equivalent to traditional biomarkers. The model was validated with neuropathological and clinical data, confirming robust generalizability without any retraining. Using zero-shot learning, we classified disease subtypes including autosomal dominant AD and prodromal PD and clarified disease states for those with conflicting clinical information. The model also showed the ability to prioritize cognitively normal individuals at disease risk. This framework enabled the identification and quantification of continuous, individual-level disease probabilities that allow for the quantification of overlap across diseases and co-pathologies within an individual. Through this work, we establish a benchmark computational framework for enhancing diagnostic precision in NDs.

Large-scale plasma proteomics uncovers preclinical molecular signatures of Parkinson's disease and overlap with other neurodegenerative disorders.	Parkinson's disease (PD) remains incurable, with a long preclinical phase currently undetectable by existing methods. In the largest proteomic study in neurodegenerative diseases to date, we analyzed blood samples from ~74,000 individuals across discovery and validation cohorts. In the EPIC4PD discovery case-cohort, large-scale profiling of 7,285 proteins (SomaScan-7K) in 4,538 initially unaffected participants (574 incident cases) identified 17 proteins that predict PD up to 28 years before diagnosis. Additional proteins revealed sex-specific effects and time-dependent effect trajectories, capturing disease progression before symptom onset. Replication in three prospective cohorts (n=64,856; 1,034 incident cases) confirmed at least 12 key pre-diagnostic biomarkers with strong evidence, including TPPP2, HPGDS, ALPL, MFAP5, OGFR, ACAD8, TCL1A, GPC4, GSTA3, LCN2, KRAS, and GJA1. Preclinical biomarkers showed 86% concordant effect directions in independent prevalent PD cases (n=2,592; p=1.6×10	EPIC; Parkinson’s disease; SomaLogic; aptamers; neurodegeneration; prediction; protein risk score; proteomics

The model was validated with neuropathological and clinical data, confirming robust generalizability without any retraining. Using zero-shot learning, we classified disease subtypes including autosomal dominant AD and prodromal PD and clarified disease states for those with conflicting clinical information. The model also showed the ability to prioritize cognitively normal individuals at disease risk. This framework enabled the identification and quantification of continuous, individual-level disease probabilities that allow for the quantification of overlap across diseases and co-pathologies within an individual. Through this work, we establish a benchmark computational framework for enhancing diagnostic precision in NDs.

The Global Neurodegeneration Proteomics Consortium: biomarker and drug target discovery for common neurodegenerative diseases and aging.	More than 57 million people globally suffer from neurodegenerative diseases, a figure expected to double every 20 years. Despite this growing burden, there are currently no cures, and treatment options remain limited due to disease heterogeneity, prolonged preclinical and prodromal phases, poor understanding of disease mechanisms, and diagnostic challenges. Identifying novel biomarkers is crucial for improving early detection, prognosis, staging and subtyping of these conditions. High-dimensional molecular studies in biofluids ('omics') offer promise for scalable biomarker discovery, but challenges in assembling large, diverse datasets hinder progress. To address this, the Global Neurodegeneration Proteomics Consortium (GNPC)-a public-private partnership-established one of the world's largest harmonized proteomic datasets. It includes approximately 250 million unique protein measurements from multiple platforms from more than 35,000 biofluid samples (plasma, serum and cerebrospinal fluid) contributed by 23 partners, alongside associated clinical data spanning Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). This dataset is accessible to GNPC members via the Alzheimer's Disease Data Initiative's AD Workbench, a secure cloud-based environment, and will be available to the wider research community on 15 July 2025. Here we present summary analyses of the plasma proteome revealing disease-specific differential protein abundance and transdiagnostic proteomic signatures of clinical severity. Furthermore, we describe a robust plasma proteomic signature of APOE ε4 carriership, reproducible across AD, PD, FTD and ALS, as well as distinct patterns of organ aging across these conditions. This work demonstrates the power of international collaboration, data sharing and open science to accelerate discovery in neurodegeneration research.

Benchmarking the AI-based diagnostic potential of plasma proteomics for neurodegenerative disease in 17,170 people.	Co-pathology is a common feature of neurodegenerative diseases that complicates diagnosis, treatment and clinical management. However, sensitive, specific and scalable biomarkers for in vivo pathological diagnosis are not available for most neurodegenerative neuropathologies. Here, we present ProtAIDe-Dx, a deep joint-learning model trained on 17,170 patients and controls that uses plasma proteomics to provide simultaneous probabilistic diagnosis across six conditions associated with dementia in aging. ProtAIDe-Dx achieves cross-validated balanced classification accuracy of 69%-96% and AUCs > 79% across all conditions. The model's diagnostic probabilities highlighted subgroups of patients with co-pathologies, and were associated with pathology-specific biomarkers in an external sample, even among cognitively unimpaired people. Model interpretation revealed a suite of protein networks marking shared and specific biological processes across diseases, and identified novel and previously described proteins discriminating each diagnosis. ProtAIDe-Dx significantly improved biomarker-based differential diagnosis in a memory clinic sample, pinpointing proteins leading to diagnostic decisions at an individual level. Together, this work highlights the promise of plasma proteomics to improve patient-level diagnostic work-up with a single blood draw.

Gamma sensory stimulation in mild Alzheimer's dementia: An open-label extension study.	INTRODUCTION: We evaluated the long-term effects of daily 40 Hz (gamma frequency) audiovisual stimulation on cognition and biomarkers in five patients with mild Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHODS: Over 2 years, patients received 1-h daily stimulation. Electroencephalography (EEG) was used to assess neural entrainment; magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measured brain volumes; actigraphy monitored activity patterns; neuropsychological tests evaluated cognition; and S-PLEX assay measured plasma pTau217. RESULTS: No adverse events occurred over the study period. Three female patients with late-onset AD (LOAD) retained strong EEG entrainment and showed less decline in Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR), and Functional Assessment Scale (FAS) scores compared to matched controls from National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC), Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), and Longitudinal Early-Onset Alzheimer's Disease Study (LEADS). Plasma samples were available for only two of five participants - both with LOAD - and both showed pTau217 reductions of 47% and 19%. DISCUSSION: These findings suggest that long-term 40 Hz audiovisual stimulation is safe, feasible, and may offer cognitive and biomarker benefits in some individuals with mild AD, supporting further investigation. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION INFORMATION: ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04055376). HIGHLIGHTS: Five mild Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients safely used daily 40 Hz audiovisual stimulation for 2 years. Late-onset AD (LOAD) patients showed increased 40 Hz electroencephalography (EEG) power and improved cognitive scores. National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC) data enhanced early-phase analysis and support precision medicine in AD studies. Plasma pTau217 declined in 2 LOAD patients after 2 years of daily use. This small pilot is the first to link long-term 40 Hz therapy to AD biomarker change.	40 Hz audiovisual stimulation; ADNI; Alzheimer's disease; LEADS; NACC; long‐term treatment; plasma pTau217

Safety and efficacy of long-term gantenerumab treatment in dominantly inherited Alzheimer's disease: an open-label extension of the phase 2/3 multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled platform DIAN-TU trial.	BACKGROUND: Amyloid plaque removal by monoclonal antibody therapies slows clinical progression in symptomatic Alzheimer's disease; however, the potential for delaying the onset of clinical symptoms in asymptomatic people is unknown. The Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network Trials Unit (DIAN-TU) is an ongoing platform trial assessing the safety and efficacy of multiple investigational products in participants with dominantly inherited Alzheimer's disease (DIAD). Based on findings of amyloid removal and downstream biological effects from the gantenerumab group of the platform trial, we continued a 3-year open-label extension (OLE) study to assess the safety and efficacy of long-term treatment with high doses of gantenerumab. METHODS: The randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, phase 2/3 multi-arm trial (DIAN-TU-001) assessed solanezumab or gantenerumab versus placebo in participants who were between 15 years before and 10 years after their estimated years to symptom onset and who had a Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) global score of 0 (cognitively normal) to 1 (mild dementia). This study was followed by an OLE study of gantenerumab treatment, conducted at 18 study sites in Australia, Canada, France, Ireland, Puerto Rico, Spain, the UK, and the USA. For inclusion in the OLE, participants at risk for DIAD had participated in the double-blind period of DIAN-TU-001 and were required to know their mutation status. We investigated increasing doses of subcutaneous gantenerumab up to 1500 mg every 2 weeks. Due to the lack of a regulatory path for gantenerumab, the study was stopped early after a prespecified interim analysis (when most participants had completed 2 years of treatment) of the clinical measure CDR-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB). The primary outcome for the final analysis was the amyloid plaque measure FINDINGS: Of 74 participants who were recruited into the OLE study between June 3, 2020, and April 22, 2021, 73 were enrolled and received gantenerumab treatment. 47 (64%) stopped dosing due to early termination of the study by the sponsor, and 13 (18%) prematurely discontinued the study for other reasons; 13 people completed 3 years of treatment. The mITT group for the primary analysis comprised 55 participants. At the interim analysis, the hazard ratio for clinical decline of CDR-SB in asymptomatic mutation carriers was 0·79 (n=53 [95% CI 0·47 to 1·32]) for participants who were treated with gantenerumab in either the double-blind or OLE period (Any Gant), and 0·53 (n=22 [0·27 to 1·03]) for participants who were treated with gantenerumab the longest (Longest Gant). At the final analysis, the adjusted mean change from OLE baseline to year 3 in PiB-PET SUVR was -0·71 SUVR (95% CI -0·88 to -0·53, p<0·0001). Amyloid-related imaging abnormalities occurred in 53% (39 of 73) of participants: 47% (34 of 73) with microhaemorrhages, 30% (22 of 73) with oedema, and 6% (five of 73) were associated with superficial siderosis. No treatment-associated macrohaemorrhages or deaths occurred. INTERPRETATION: Partial or short-term amyloid removal did not show significant clinical effects. However, long-term full amyloid removal potentially delayed symptom onset and dementia progression. Our conclusions are limited due to the OLE design and use of external controls and need to be confirmed in long-term trials.

Amyloid PET in Sporadic Early- Versus Late-Onset Alzheimer's Disease: Comparison of the LEADS and ADNI Cohorts.	OBJECTIVE: Early-onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD) and late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) differ in many respects. Here, we address the issue of possible differences in fibrillar amyloid pathology as measured by positron emission tomography (PET), which remains unresolved due to the lack of large-scale comparative studies. METHODS: Three hundred ninety-nine cognitively impaired participants younger than 65 years of age from the multicenter Longitudinal Early-onset Alzheimer's Disease Study (LEADS) and 450 cognitively impaired participants older than 65 years from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) underwent clinical assessment, brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and amyloid PET and were included in this study. We compared amyloid PET outcomes (positivity rate based on visual read and quantified tracer uptake expressed as Centiloids [CLs]) between the 2 cohorts and studied their association with age, sex, APOE genotype, and cognition. RESULTS: The amyloid positivity rate was higher in LEADS (78%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 74-82) than in ADNI (71%, 95% CI = 67-75, p = 0.02). Lower Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and APOE4 genotype increased the odds of amyloid positivity in both cohorts. Visually positive scans had higher CLs in LEADS (EOAD, mean = 95.3 ± 26.1) than in ADNI (LOAD, mean = 80.9 ± 36.8, p < 0.0001), predominantly in parietal cortex/precuneus, superior temporal, and frontal cortices. In amyloid-positive patients, (1) CLs were higher in female patients in both cohorts; (2) APOE4 carriership was associated with lower CLs in EOAD, which was not observed in LOAD; and (3) correlations between CLs and MMSE scores were significantly stronger in EOAD than in LOAD. INTERPRETATION: Differences in the burden of amyloid pathology may contribute to differences in clinical and anatomic patterns in sporadic EOAD and LOAD, and have implications for optimizing therapeutic strategies in each group.

Dissociable spatial topography of cortical atrophy in early-onset and late-onset Alzheimer's disease: A head-to-head comparison of the LEADS and ADNI cohorts.	INTRODUCTION: Early-onset and late-onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD and LOAD, respectively) have distinct clinical manifestations, with prior work based on small samples suggesting unique patterns of neurodegeneration. The current study performed a head-to-head comparison of cortical atrophy in EOAD and LOAD, using two large and well-characterized cohorts (LEADS and ADNI). METHODS: We analyzed brain structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data acquired from 377 sporadic EOAD patients and 317 sporadicLOAD patients who were amyloid positive and had mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or mild dementia (i.e., early-stage AD), along with cognitively unimpaired participants. RESULTS: After controlling for the level of cognitive impairment, we found a double dissociation between AD clinical phenotype and localization/magnitude of atrophy, characterized by predominant neocortical involvement in EOAD and more focal anterior medial temporal involvement in LOAD. DISCUSSION: Our findings point to the clinical utility of MRI-based biomarkers of atrophy in differentiating between EOAD and LOAD, which may be useful for diagnosis, prognostication, and treatment. HIGHLIGHTS: Early-onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD) and late-onset AD (LOAD) patients showed distinct and overlapping cortical atrophy patterns. EOAD patients showed prominent atrophy in widespread neocortical regions. LOAD patients showed prominent atrophy in the anterior medial temporal lobe.

Heterogeneous clinical phenotypes of sporadic early-onset Alzheimer's disease: a neuropsychological data-driven approach.	"BACKGROUND: The clinical presentations of early-onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD) and late-onset Alzheimer's disease are distinct, with EOAD having a more aggressive disease course with greater heterogeneity. Recent publications from the Longitudinal Early-Onset Alzheimer's Disease Study (LEADS) described EOAD as predominantly amnestic, though this phenotypic description was based solely on clinical judgment. To better understand the phenotypic range of EOAD presentation, we applied a neuropsychological data-driven method to subtype the LEADS cohort. METHODS: Neuropsychological test performance from 169 amyloid-positive EOAD participants were analyzed. Education-corrected normative comparisons were made using a sample of 98 cognitively normal participants. Comparing the relative levels of impairment between each cognitive domain, we applied a cut-off of 1 SD below all other domain scores to indicate a phenotype of ""predominant"" impairment in a given cognitive domain. Individuals were otherwise considered to have multidomain impairment. Whole-cortex general linear modeling of cortical atrophy was applied as an MRI-based validation of these distinct clinical phenotypes. RESULTS: We identified 6 phenotypic subtypes of EOAD: Dysexecutive Predominant (22% of sample), Amnestic Predominant (11%), Language Predominant (11%), Visuospatial Predominant (15%), Mixed Amnestic/Dysexecutive Predominant (11%), and Multidomain (30%). These phenotypes did not differ by age, sex, or years of education. The APOE ɛ4 genotype was enriched in the Amnestic Predominant group, who were also rated as least impaired. Cortical thickness analysis validated these clinical phenotypes with dissociations in atrophy patterns observed between the Dysexecutive and Amnestic Predominant groups. In contrast to the heterogeneity observed from our neuropsychological data-driven approach, diagnostic classifications for this same sample based solely on clinical judgment indicated that 82% of individuals were amnestic-predominant, 9% were non-amnestic, 4% met criteria for Posterior Cortical Atrophy, and 5% met criteria for Primary Progressive Aphasia. CONCLUSION: A neuropsychological data-driven method to phenotype EOAD individuals uncovered a more detailed understanding of the presenting heterogeneity in this atypical AD sample compared to clinical judgment alone. Clinicians and patients may over-report memory dysfunction at the expense of non-memory symptoms. These findings have important implications for diagnostic accuracy and treatment considerations."

Consensus recommendations for clinical assessment tools for the diagnosis of posterior cortical atrophy syndrome from the Atypical AD PIA of ISTAART.	INTRODUCTION: Delay in diagnosis of posterior cortical atrophy (PCA) syndrome is common, and the lack of familiarity with assessment tools for identifying visual cortical dysfunction is a contributing factor. We propose recommendations for the approach to the evaluation of PCA clinical features during the office visit, the neuropsychological evaluation, and the research setting. A recommended screening battery for eye clinics is also proposed. METHODS: Recommendations were developed using results from a web-based survey of members of Alzheimer's Association International Society to Advance Alzheimer's Research and Treatment (ISTAART) Atypical Alzheimer's Disease Professional Interest Area (PIA), literature review, and consensus by the PCA assessment working party of the Atypical Alzheimer's Disease PIA. RESULTS: Survey results revealed robust agreement for assessment tool preferences for PCA features, and many respondents indicated that they reserve assessment tools for use only when PCA is suspected. For some PCA features, curated tools were preferred over validated battery tools, particularly for the office visit. Consensus recommendations superseded survey preferences for two core cognitive features within the 2017 PCA diagnostic criteria. DISCUSSION: These consensus recommendations provide an evaluation framework for PCA clinical features and can facilitate timely and accurate recognition and diagnosis of PCA. Broader use of these tools should be sought, and development and validation of novel PCA clinical outcome assessments are needed to improve our understanding of atypical AD and other dementias and support the inclusion of those with PCA in treatment trials.

Impaired Skeletal Development by Disruption of Presenilin-1 in Pigs and Generation of Novel Pig Models for Alzheimer's Disease.	BACKGROUND: Presenilin 1 (PSEN1) is one of the genes linked to the prevalence of early onset Alzheimer's disease. In mice, inactivation of Psen1 leads to developmental defects, including vertebral malformation and neural development. However, little is known about the role of PSEN1 during the development in other species. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the role of PSEN1 in vertebral development and the pathogenic mechanism of neurodegeneration using a pig model. METHODS: CRISPR/Cas9 system was used to generate pigs with different mutations flanking exon 9 of PSEN1, including those with a deleted exon 9 (Δexon9). Vertebral malformations in PSEN1 mutant pigs were examined by X-ray, micro-CT and micro-MRI. Neuronal cells from the brains of PSEN1 mutant pigs were analyzed by immunoflourescence, followed by image analysis including morphometric evaluation via image J and 3D reconstruction. RESULTS: Pigs with a PSEN1 null mutation (Δexon9-12) died shortly after birth and had significant axial skeletal defects, whereas pigs carrying at least one Δexon9 allele developed normally and remained healthy. Effects of the null mutation on abnormal skeletal development were also observed in fetuses at day 40 of gestation. Abnormal distribution of astrocytes and microglia in the brain was detected in two PSEN1 mutant pigs examined compared to age-matched control pigs. The founder pigs were bred to establish and age PSEN1ΔE9/+ pigs to study their relevance to clinical Alzheimer's diseases. CONCLUSIONS: PSEN1 has a critical role for normal vertebral development and PSEN1 mutant pigs serves as novel resources to study Alzheimer's disease.

Presenilin-1 mutation position influences amyloidosis, small vessel disease, and dementia with disease stage.	INTRODUCTION: Amyloidosis, including cerebral amyloid angiopathy, and markers of small vessel disease (SVD) vary across dominantly inherited Alzheimer's disease (DIAD) presenilin-1 (PSEN1) mutation carriers. We investigated how mutation position relative to codon 200 (pre-/postcodon 200) influences these pathologic features and dementia at different stages. METHODS: Individuals from families with known PSEN1 mutations (n = 393) underwent neuroimaging and clinical assessments. We cross-sectionally evaluated regional Pittsburgh compound B-positron emission tomography uptake, magnetic resonance imaging markers of SVD (diffusion tensor imaging-based white matter injury, white matter hyperintensity volumes, and microhemorrhages), and cognition. RESULTS: Postcodon 200 carriers had lower amyloid burden in all regions but worse markers of SVD and worse Clinical Dementia Rating DISCUSSION: We demonstrated the genotypic variability behind spatiotemporal amyloidosis, SVD, and clinical presentation in DIAD, which may inform patient prognosis and clinical trials. HIGHLIGHTS: Mutation position influences Aβ burden, SVD, and dementia. PSEN1 pre-200 group had stronger associations between Aβ burden and disease stage. PSEN1 post-200 group had stronger associations between SVD markers and disease stage. PSEN1 post-200 group had worse dementia score than pre-200 in late disease stage. Diffusion tensor imaging-based SVD markers mediated mutation position effects on dementia in the late stage.

Demographic, clinical, biomarker, and neuropathological correlates of posterior cortical atrophy: an international cohort study and individual participant data meta-analysis.	BACKGROUND: Posterior cortical atrophy is a rare syndrome characterised by early, prominent, and progressive impairment in visuoperceptual and visuospatial processing. The disorder has been associated with underlying neuropathological features of Alzheimer's disease, but large-scale biomarker and neuropathological studies are scarce. We aimed to describe demographic, clinical, biomarker, and neuropathological correlates of posterior cortical atrophy in a large international cohort. METHODS: We searched PubMed between database inception and Aug 1, 2021, for all published research studies on posterior cortical atrophy and related terms. We identified research centres from these studies and requested deidentified, individual participant data (published and unpublished) that had been obtained at the first diagnostic visit from the corresponding authors of the studies or heads of the research centres. Inclusion criteria were a clinical diagnosis of posterior cortical atrophy as defined by the local centre and availability of Alzheimer's disease biomarkers (PET or CSF), or a diagnosis made at autopsy. Not all individuals with posterior cortical atrophy fulfilled consensus criteria, being diagnosed using centre-specific procedures or before development of consensus criteria. We obtained demographic, clinical, biofluid, neuroimaging, and neuropathological data. Mean values for continuous variables were combined using the inverse variance meta-analysis method; only research centres with more than one participant for a variable were included. Pooled proportions were calculated for binary variables using a restricted maximum likelihood model. Heterogeneity was quantified using I FINDINGS: We identified 55 research centres from 1353 papers, with 29 centres responding to our request. An additional seven centres were recruited by advertising via the Alzheimer's Association. We obtained data for 1092 individuals who were evaluated at 36 research centres in 16 countries, the other sites having not responded to our initial invitation to participate to the study. Mean age at symptom onset was 59·4 years (95% CI 58·9-59·8; I INTERPRETATION: These data indicate that posterior cortical atrophy typically presents as a pure, young-onset dementia syndrome that is highly specific for underlying Alzheimer's disease pathology. Further work is needed to understand what drives cognitive vulnerability and progression rates by investigating the contribution of sex, genetics, premorbid cognitive strengths and weaknesses, and brain network integrity.

Alzheimer's polygenic risk scores are associated with cognitive phenotypes in Down syndrome.	INTRODUCTION: This study aimed to investigate the influence of the overall Alzheimer's disease (AD) genetic architecture on Down syndrome (DS) status, cognitive measures, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers. METHODS: AD polygenic risk scores (PRS) were tested for association with DS-related traits. RESULTS: The AD risk PRS was associated with disease status in several cohorts of sporadic late- and early-onset and familial late-onset AD, but not in familial early-onset AD or DS. On the other hand, lower DS Mental Status Examination memory scores were associated with higher PRS, independent of intellectual disability and APOE (PRS including APOE, PRS DISCUSSION: These data indicate that the AD genetic architecture influences cognitive and CSF phenotypes in DS adults, supporting common pathways that influence memory decline in both traits. HIGHLIGHTS: Examination of the polygenic risk of AD in DS presented here is the first of its kind. AD PRS influences memory aspects in DS individuals, independently of APOE genotype. These results point to an overlap between the genes and pathways that leads to AD and those that influence dementia and memory decline in the DS population. APOE ε4 is linked to DS cognitive decline, expanding cognitive insights in adults.

The Sporadic Early-onset Alzheimer's Disease Signature Of Atrophy: Preliminary Findings From The Longitudinal Early-onset Alzheimer's Disease Study (LEADS) Cohort.	INTRODUCTION: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) research has advanced our understanding of neurodegeneration in sporadic early-onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD) but studies include small samples, mostly amnestic EOAD, and have not focused on developing an MRI biomarker. METHODS: We analyzed MRI scans to define the sporadic EOAD-signature atrophy in a small sample (n = 25) of Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) EOAD patients, investigated its reproducibility in the large longitudinal early-onset Alzheimer's disease study (LEADS) sample (n = 211), and investigated the relationship of the magnitude of atrophy with cognitive impairment. RESULTS: The EOAD-signature atrophy was replicated across the two cohorts, with prominent atrophy in the caudal lateral temporal cortex, inferior parietal lobule, and posterior cingulate and precuneus cortices, and with relative sparing of the medial temporal lobe. The magnitude of EOAD-signature atrophy was associated with the severity of cognitive impairment. DISCUSSION: The EOAD-signature atrophy is a reliable and clinically valid biomarker of AD-related neurodegeneration that could be used in clinical trials for EOAD. HIGHLIGHTS: We developed an early-onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD)-signature of atrophy based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. EOAD signature was robustly reproducible across two independent patient cohorts. EOAD signature included prominent atrophy in parietal and posterior temporal cortex.

Amyloid and tau-PET in early-onset AD: Baseline data from the Longitudinal Early-onset Alzheimer's Disease Study (LEADS).	INTRODUCTION: We aimed to describe baseline amyloid-beta (Aβ) and tau-positron emission tomograrphy (PET) from Longitudinal Early-onset Alzheimer's Disease Study (LEADS), a prospective multi-site observational study of sporadic early-onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD). METHODS: We analyzed baseline [18F]Florbetaben (Aβ) and [18F]Flortaucipir (tau)-PET from cognitively impaired participants with a clinical diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or AD dementia aged < 65 years. Florbetaben scans were used to distinguish cognitively impaired participants with EOAD (Aβ+) from EOnonAD (Aβ-) based on the combination of visual read by expert reader and image quantification. RESULTS: 243/321 (75.7%) of participants were assigned to the EOAD group based on amyloid-PET; 231 (95.1%) of them were tau-PET positive (A+T+). Tau-PET signal was elevated across cortical regions with a parietal-predominant pattern, and higher burden was observed in younger and female EOAD participants. DISCUSSION: LEADS data emphasizes the importance of biomarkers to enhance diagnostic accuracy in EOAD. The advanced tau-PET binding at baseline might have implications for therapeutic strategies in patients with EOAD. HIGHLIGHTS: 72% of patients with clinical EOAD were positive on both amyloid- and tau-PET. Amyloid-positive patients with EOAD had high tau-PET signal across cortical regions. In EOAD, tau-PET mediated the relationship between amyloid-PET and MMSE. Among EOAD patients, younger onset and female sex were associated with higher tau-PET.

Sex and APOE ε4 carrier effects on atrophy, amyloid PET, and tau PET burden in early-onset Alzheimer's disease.	INTRODUCTION: We used sex and apolipoprotein E ε4 (APOE ε4) carrier status as predictors of pathologic burden in early-onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD). METHODS: We included baseline data from 77 cognitively normal (CN), 230 EOAD, and 70 EO non-Alzheimer's disease (EOnonAD) participants from the Longitudinal Early-Onset Alzheimer's Disease Study (LEADS). We stratified each diagnostic group by males and females, then further subdivided each sex by APOE ε4 carrier status and compared imaging biomarkers in each stratification. Voxel-wise multiple linear regressions yielded statistical brain maps of gray matter density, amyloid, and tau PET burden. RESULTS: EOAD females had greater amyloid and tau PET burdens than males. EOAD female APOE ε4 non-carriers had greater amyloid PET burdens and greater gray matter atrophy than female ε4 carriers. EOnonAD female ε4 non-carriers also had greater gray matter atrophy than female ε4 carriers. DISCUSSION: The effects of sex and APOE ε4 must be considered when studying these populations. HIGHLIGHTS: Novel analysis examining the effects of biological sex and apolipoprotein E ε4 (APOE ε4) carrier status on neuroimaging biomarkers among early-onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD), early-onset non-AD (EOnonAD), and cognitively normal (CN) participants. Female sex is associated with greater pathology burden in the EOAD cohort compared to male sex. The effect of APOE ε4 carrier status on pathology burden was the most impactful in females across all cohorts.

Cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers in the Longitudinal Early-onset Alzheimer's Disease Study.	INTRODUCTION: One goal of the Longitudinal Early Onset Alzheimer's Disease Study (LEADS) is to define the fluid biomarker characteristics of early-onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD). METHODS: Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations of Aβ1-40, Aβ1-42, total tau (tTau), pTau181, VILIP-1, SNAP-25, neurogranin (Ng), neurofilament light chain (NfL), and YKL-40 were measured by immunoassay in 165 LEADS participants. The associations of biomarker concentrations with diagnostic group and standard cognitive tests were evaluated. RESULTS: Biomarkers were correlated with one another. Levels of CSF Aβ42/40, pTau181, tTau, SNAP-25, and Ng in EOAD differed significantly from cognitively normal and early-onset non-AD dementia; NfL, YKL-40, and VILIP-1 did not. Across groups, all biomarkers except SNAP-25 were correlated with cognition. Within the EOAD group, Aβ42/40, NfL, Ng, and SNAP-25 were correlated with at least one cognitive measure. DISCUSSION: This study provides a comprehensive analysis of CSF biomarkers in sporadic EOAD that can inform EOAD clinical trial design.

White matter hyperintensities are higher among early-onset Alzheimer's disease participants than their cognitively normal and early-onset nonAD peers: Longitudinal Early-onset Alzheimer's Disease Study (LEADS).	INTRODUCTION: We compared white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) in early-onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD) with cognitively normal (CN) and early-onset amyloid-negative cognitively impaired (EOnonAD) groups in the Longitudinal Early-Onset Alzheimer's Disease Study. METHODS: We investigated the role of increased WMH in cognition and amyloid and tau burden. We compared WMH burden of 205 EOAD, 68 EOnonAD, and 89 CN participants in lobar regions using t-tests and analyses of covariance. Linear regression analyses were used to investigate the association between WMH and cognitive impairment and that between amyloid and tau burden. RESULTS: EOAD showed greater WMHs compared with CN and EOnonAD participants across all regions with no significant differences between CN and EOnonAD groups. Greater WMHs were associated with worse cognition. Tau burden was positively associated with WMH burden in the EOAD group. DISCUSSION: EOAD consistently showed higher WMH volumes. Overall, greater WMHs were associated with worse cognition and higher tau burden in EOAD. HIGHLIGHTS: This study represents a comprehensive characterization of WMHs in sporadic EOAD. WMH volumes are associated with tau burden from positron emission tomography (PET) in EOAD, suggesting WMHs are correlated with increasing burden of AD. Greater WMH volumes are associated with worse performance on global cognitive tests. EOAD participants have higher WMH volumes compared with CN and early-onset amyloid-negative cognitively impaired (EOnonAD) groups across all brain regions.

Neuropathological changes and amyloid-related imaging abnormalities in Alzheimer's disease treated with aducanumab versus untreated: a retrospective case-control study.	BACKGROUND: Understanding the neuropathological effects of amyloid β (Aβ)-targeting therapies and amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA) in Alzheimer's disease is critical for optimising treatment efficacy and patient outcomes. Comparing Aβ PET imaging with neuropathological assessments provides context for evaluating the extent of Aβ clearance and interpreting in-vivo biomarkers. We aimed to assess clinicopathological changes and ARIA-related effects in aducanumab-treated versus untreated Alzheimer's disease. METHODS: This retrospective case-control study included five aducanumab-treated participants from clinical trials conducted at the Mayo Clinic (2016-21) who underwent autopsy (2020-23). Treated participants were matched by autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease mutation or APOE genotype, age at cognitive symptom onset, and sex to 12 untreated participants from the Mayo Clinic Alzheimer's Disease Research Center and Mayo Clinic Study of Aging cohorts in the Mayo Clinic brain bank (Jacksonville, FL, USA). Cognitive, imaging, and neuropathological outcomes were compared using descriptive analyses and Mann-Whitney U tests. FINDINGS: Aducanumab-treated participants comprised four males and one female, all carrying at least one APOE ∊4 allele, with two harbouring a PSEN1 mutation. Cumulative dosages of aducanumab ranged from 5 mg/kg to 241 mg/kg; all participants cognitively declined during treatment, and two exhibited ARIA. Reductions in [ INTERPRETATION: Disproportionate Aβ clearance and ARIA-associated neuropathology localised to superficial cortical layers suggest a distinctive pattern of target engagement by aducanumab. These findings inform understanding and monitoring of similar Aβ-targeting therapies. FUNDING: Alzheimer Nederland, National Institute on Aging, and Alzheimer's Association.

BACKGROUND: Antemortem plasma and structural MRI biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are increasingly utilized for diagnosis and prognosis but their ability to predict regional tau burden remains relatively unexplored. We aimed to evaluate predictive models based on antemortem AD plasma and structural MRI for prediction of regional tau pathology in postmortem brain tissue. METHODS: Autopsy data from 62 participants in the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging (MCSA) were analyzed (mean age of 84.6 years; 32% female; 1.4 years of mean time of last plasma draw to death). Tau pathology in the hippocampus and parietal cortex was quantified using two immunohistochemical markers: AT8, an early tangle maturity marker, and 2E9, an advanced tangle maturity marker. Three antemortem plasma markers including phosphorylated tau protein at threonine 181 (p-tau181), total amyloid-β (Aβ) 42 relative to Aβ40 ratio (Aβ42/40), and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and three regional structural MRI markers including the hippocampus volume adjusted for total intracranial volume (HVA), parietal thickness (PTH) and parietal volume divided by total intracranial volume (PVTIV) were utilized as predictors. Weighted linear regression models using weights based on time from last plasma draw to death were adjusted for age, sex and cardiovascular and metabolic conditions (CMC) score for patients. We report estimated adjusted R RESULTS: MRI models (adjusted R CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates the greater sensitivity of regional MRI to tau pathology in comparison to plasma biomarkers. Future studies should explore newer MRI methods and additional plasma biomarkers more specific to tau pathology such as microtubule binding region for prediction of antemortem tau pathology.

Staging Alzheimer's disease through amyloid and tau PET.	A workgroup assembled by the Alzheimer's Association recently described a conceptual framework for Alzheimer's disease biological staging based on amyloid and tau positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. However, specific tau PET cut points were left to be determined, a step necessary prior to clinical application. We sought to operationalize and evaluate Alzheimer's disease biological staging by identifying meaningful tau PET cut points to define the four biological stages in a well-characterized participant cohort and describe the features of individuals placed into the different biological stages. The primary analysis included 896 participants in the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging or the Mayo Clinic Alzheimer's Disease Research Center longitudinal cohorts. A validation cohort consisted of 328 participants in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. Both cognitively normal and impaired individuals with positive amyloid PET and evaluable tau PET imaging were included. Tau PET cut points were identified with Gaussian Mixture Models to characterize Alzheimer's disease biological stage in study participants with different clinical diagnoses and objective degrees of cognitive impairment as measured by Mini-Mental State Examination. A tau PET cut point in the medial temporal region and two cut points in the temporoparietal region were identified to collectively produce the four Alzheimer's disease biological stages described in the revised criteria. Increasing stage was associated with greater likelihood of mild cognitive impairment and dementia diagnosis and worsening cognitive performance on Mini-Mental State Examination and Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes, a result that was reproduced in the independent Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative cohort. This study provided empiric validation for the concept of using amyloid PET and tau PET to separate subjects with biomarker-proven Alzheimer's disease into four biological stages with distinct characteristics.	biomarkers; dementia; neuroimaging

Association of plasma Alzheimer's disease biomarkers with cognitive decline in cognitively unimpaired individuals.	INTRODUCTION: Plasma biomarkers' utility for predicting incident mild cognitive impairment (MCI) remains unclear. We evaluated associations of plasma Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers and amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) with transitions from cognitively unimpaired (CU) to MCI in the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging (MCSA) and BioFINDER-2 studies. METHODS: Associations of continuous baseline plasma biomarker levels and amyloid PET Centiloid with progression to MCI, adjusting for age, sex, and education, were evaluated with Cox proportional hazards models. RESULTS: The study included 381 MCSA and 584 BioFINDER-2 participants. Amyloid PET and percent phosphorylated to non-phosphorylated tau217 (%p-tau217) were strong predictors of progression to MCI in both cohorts: hazard ratios of 1.49 and 1.23 in the MCSA and 1.72 and 1.65 in BioFINDER, respectively. Amyloid beta 42/40 was a significant predictor in BioFINDER-2 only (hazard ratio 2.20). DISCUSSION: Plasma %p-tau217 was associated with progression from CU to MCI in both cohorts, although differences in biomarker associations may be related to differences in the two cohorts. HIGHLIGHTS: Mass-spectrometry-based plasma phosphorylated tau217 was associated with cognitively unimpaired to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) progression. Plasma amyloid beta 42/40 was a significant predictor in BioFINDER but not the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging (MCSA). Amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) was the strongest predictor of progression to MCI in the MCSA. Plasma had added value to amyloid PET in BioFINDER but not the MCSA. Biomarker performance may vary with cohort and biomarker measurement differences.

Tau PET positivity in individuals with and without cognitive impairment varies with age, amyloid-β status, APOE genotype and sex.	Tau positron emission tomography (PET) imaging allows in vivo detection of tau proteinopathy in Alzheimer's disease, which is associated with neurodegeneration and cognitive decline. Understanding how demographic, clinical and genetic factors relate to tau PET positivity will facilitate its use for clinical practice and research. Here we conducted an analysis of 42 cohorts worldwide (N = 12,048), including 7,394 cognitively unimpaired (CU) participants, 2,177 participants with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 2,477 participants with dementia. We found that from age 60 years to 80 years, tau PET positivity in a temporal composite region increased from 1.1% to 4.4% among CU amyloid-β (Aβ)-negative participants and from 17.4% to 22.2% among CU Aβ-positive participants. Across the same age span, tau PET positivity decreased from 68.0% to 52.9% in participants with MCI and from 91.5% to 74.6% in participants with dementia. Age, Aβ status, APOE ε4 carriership and female sex were all associated with a higher prevalence of tau PET positivity across groups. APOE ε4 carriership in CU individuals lowered the age at onset of both Aβ positivity and tau positivity by decades. Finally, we replicated these associations in an independent autopsy dataset (N = 5,072 from 3 cohorts).

Associations between temporal lobe cortical NODDI measures and memory function in individuals without clinical dementia.	INTRODUCTION: Temporal cortical microstructural changes precede cortical atrophy during memory decline. We used neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) to assess such early microstructural change. METHODS: Cognitively unimpaired (CU, n = 725) and mildly cognitively impaired (MCI, n = 111) participants from the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging underwent 3T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), including NODDI and neuropsychological evaluation for calculation of memory z scores. Linear mixed effects modelling assessed the relationship between temporal cortical Neurite Density Index (NDI), Orientation Dispersion Index (ODI), and both baseline and mean annual change in memory z scores. RESULTS: NDI was significantly associated with both baseline memory z scores and mean annual change of memory z scores, in the hippocampi and amygdalae. Similar significant associations with ODI were seen in hippocampi, parahippocampal, and fusiform gyri. DISCUSSION: Temporal cortical NDI and ODI are early imaging biomarkers of cortical microstructural integrity that may predict memory decline in CU and MCI individuals. HIGHLIGHTS: We imaged 836 participants in the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging, who were either cognitively unimpaired (CU) or suffered from mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) is an advanced diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique We found significant associations between new NODDI imaging biomarkers of microstructural integrity and memory function in CU and MCI individuals These relationships were both cross-sectional in nature and associated with future memory decline Future application of NODDI imaging biomarkers in the setting of anti-amyloid monoclonal antibody therapy may provide greater insight into memory decline than current cortical atrophy measures.

IMPORTANCE: Alzheimer disease (AD) predominates in females at almost twice the rate relative to males. Mounting evidence in adults without AD indicates that females exhibit higher tau deposition than age-matched males, particularly in the setting of elevated β-amyloid (Aβ), but the evidence for sex differences in tau accumulation rates is inconclusive. OBJECTIVE: To examine whether female sex is associated with faster tau accumulation in the setting of high Aβ (as measured with positron emission tomography [PET]) and the moderating influence of sex on the association between APOEε4 carrier status and tau accumulation. DATA SOURCES: This meta-analysis used data from 6 longitudinal aging and AD studies, including the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, Berkeley Aging Cohort Study, BioFINDER 1, Harvard Aging Brain Study, Mayo Clinic Study of Aging, and Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer Prevention. Longitudinal data were collected between November 2004 and May 2022. STUDY SELECTION: Included studies required available longitudinal [18F]flortaucipir or [18F]-MK-6240 tau-PET scans, as well as baseline [11C] Pittsburgh Compound B, [18F]flutemetamol or [18F]florbetapir Aβ-PET scans. Recruitment criteria varied across studies. Analyses began on August 7, 2023, and were completed on February 5, 2024. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: In each study, primary analyses extracted estimates for the sex (female or male) and the sex by baseline Aβ-PET status (high or low) association with longitudinal tau-PET using a series of mixed-effects models. Secondary mixed-effects models extracted the interaction estimate for the association of sex by APOEε4 carrier status with longitudinal tau-PET. Study-specific estimates for each mixed-effects model were then pooled in a meta-analysis, and the global fixed effect (β) and total heterogeneity (I2) across studies were estimated. This study is reported following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) reporting guideline. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Seven tau-PET outcomes that showed cross-sectional sex differences were examined across temporal, parietal, and occipital lobes. RESULTS: Among 6 studies assessed, there were 1376 participants (761 [55%] female; mean [range] age at first tau scan, 71.9 [46-93] years; 401 participants [29%] with high baseline Aβ; 412 APOEε4 carriers [30%]). Among individuals with high baseline Aβ, female sex was associated with faster tau accumulation localized to inferior temporal (β = -0.14; 95% CI, -0.22 to -0.06; P = .009) temporal fusiform (β = -0.13; 95% CI, -0.23 to -0.04; P = .02), and lateral occipital regions (β = -0.15; 95% CI, -0.24 to -0.06; P = .009) compared with male sex. Among APOEε4 carriers, female sex was associated with faster inferior-temporal tau accumulation (β = -0.10; 95% CI, -0.16 to -0.03; P = .01). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These findings suggest that sex differences in the pathological progression of AD call for sex-specific timing considerations when administrating anti-Aβ and anti-tau treatments.

Plasma Alzheimer's disease biomarker relationships with incident abnormal amyloid PET.	INTRODUCTION: Limited data exist on the utility of plasma biomarkers to predict incident abnormal amyloid positron emission tomography (PET). In this study we evaluate the association of plasma Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers with amyloid PET progression among initially amyloid PET negative (A-) individuals. METHODS: We included 290 A-, cognitively unimpaired Mayo Clinic Study of Aging participants. We estimated the association of each baseline plasma biomarker with progression from A- to A+ and with rate of amyloid PET change. RESULTS: Interquartile range differences in amyloid beta 42/40, percent phosphorylated tau 217 (%p-tau217), and Amyloid Probability Score 2 were associated with 1.29 (P = 0.09), 1.38 (P < 0.001), and 1.20 (P = 0.05) increases, respectively, in the hazard of progression from A- to A+ and 0.27 (P = 0.16), 0.50 (P = 0.007), and 0.28 (P = 0.15) Centiloid/year increases, respectively, in annual rate of amyloid PET change. DISCUSSION: Plasma %p-tau217 may be a useful screening tool to enrich for participants with increased likelihood of progressing from normal to abnormal amyloid PET in a primary prevention trial. HIGHLIGHTS: Plasma phosphorylated tau 217 was associated with amyloid positron emission tomography progression, negative to positive. The associations were weaker for amyloid beta 42/40 and Amyloid Probability Score 2. Age and apolipoprotein E ε4 carriership were also important predictors. These markers may be useful for enrichment of a primary prevention trial.

The study aimed to assess eligibility for donanemab phase 3 trial in participants of the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or mild dementia consistent with Alzheimer's disease (AD) clinical syndrome, positive brain amyloid burden, and available tau PET. There were 817 study participants, 60-85 years old, with MCI or dementia consistent with AD clinical syndrome. Applying the Mini-Mental State Examination criteria (20 to 28) and excluding participants with imaging contraindications reduced the sample to 769; 275 participants had amyloid PET available, of whom 130 had also tau PET at the same visit; 56 participants were amyloid positive, had tau PET available at the same visit, and of those, 27 had evidence of tau pathology measured by 18F-flortaucipir PET imaging. Additional eligibility criteria reduced the eligible participants to 23 % (13 out of 56 participants). Neuroimaging findings, central nervous system exclusions, and history of malignancy were the major exclusions.	Clinical trials; Donanemab; Eligibility

Identifying gait differences between Alzheimer's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies and their associations with regional amyloid deposition.	INTRODUCTION: We aimed to compare gait between individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and cognitively unimpaired (CU) individuals and to evaluate the association between gait and regional amyloid beta (Aβ) burden in AD and DLB. METHODS: We included 420 participants (70 AD, 70 DLB, 280 CU) in the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging (MCSA). Gait was assessed using a pressure-sensor walkway. Aβ deposition was analyzed with Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) positron emission topography (PET). RESULTS: The DLB group had reduced stride velocity, step length, and stride width variability, as well as increased double support percentage (%DS) and variability in step length, swing time, and step time compared to the AD and CU groups. Aβ burden was not associated with any gait outcomes. DISCUSSION: This study provides additional evidence that gait differs between AD and DLB. Larger studies are needed to investigate associations between Aβ burden and gait outcomes in dementia. HIGHLIGHTS: Gait was more impaired in dementia than in cognitively unimpaired (CU) controls. Compared with Alzheimer's disease (AD), Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) had more impaired pace, variability, and postural control. Step length and double support (%) distinguished DLB and AD with moderate accuracy.	Alzheimer's disease; PiB‐PET; amyloid; dementia; dementia with Lewy bodies; gait; neuroimaging

Quantitative Assessment of the Effect of Chronic Kidney Disease on Plasma P-Tau217 Concentrations.	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is known to be associated with increased plasma phosphorylated tau217 (p-tau217) concentrations, potentially confounding the utility of plasma p-tau217 measurements as a marker of amyloid pathology in individuals with suspected Alzheimer disease (AD). In this study, we quantitatively investigate the relationship of plasma p-tau217 concentrations vs estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in individuals with CKD with and without amyloid pathology. METHODS: This was a retrospective examination of data from 2 observational cohorts from either the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging or the Alzheimer's Disease Research Center cohorts. p-Tau217 was determined using the ALZpath Simoa p-tau217 immunoassay and an immunoprecipitation mass spectrometry assay that simultaneously measures p-tau217 and nonphosphorylated-tau217 (np-tau217) to determine %p-tau217 ([p-tau217/nonphosphorylated-tau217]) × 100%) (C RESULTS: Participants (n = 202, mean age of 78 years, 38% female) with diagnoses of cognitive unimpairment (n = 109), mild cognitive impairment (n = 71), and dementia (n = 22) were included. In all, 114 (56%) of all participants were amyloid-PET positive (A+). In addition, 86 (43%) of all participants were classified as having CKD (CKD stages 3-4). p-Tau217 concentrations were significantly higher in A- participants with an eGFR of <60 (mL/min/1.73 m DISCUSSION: CKD was associated with increased p-tau217 concentrations when measuring p-tau217 by ALZpath and C CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class II evidence that in individuals with CKD stage 3 (especially stage 3b) or higher, p-tau217 concentrations are increased, with a greater increase in amyloid-PET-negative individuals.

A data-driven framework for biomarker discovery applied to optimizing modern clinical and preclinical trials on Alzheimer's disease.	PET is used to measure tau protein accumulation in Alzheimer's disease. Multiple biomarkers have been proposed to track disease progression, most notably the standardized uptake value ratio of PET tracer uptake in a target region of interest relative to a reference region, but literature suggests these region choices are nontrivial. This study presents and evaluates a novel framework, BioDisCVR, designed to facilitate the discovery of useful biomarkers, demonstrated on [	Alzheimer; biomarker; clinical trial; imaging; tau

Non-rapid eye movement sleep slow-wave activity features are associated with amyloid accumulation in older adults with obstructive sleep apnoea.	Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is associated with an increased risk for cognitive impairment and dementia, which likely involves Alzheimer's disease pathology. Non-rapid eye movement slow-wave activity (SWA) has been implicated in amyloid clearance, but it has not been studied in the context of longitudinal amyloid accumulation in OSA. This longitudinal retrospective study aims to investigate the relationship between polysomnographic and electrophysiological SWA features and amyloid accumulation. From the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging cohort, we identified 71 participants ≥60 years old with OSA (mean baseline age = 72.9 ± 7.5 years, 60.6% male, 93% cognitively unimpaired) who had at least 2 consecutive Amyloid Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB)-PET scans and a polysomnographic study within 5 years of the baseline scan and before the second scan. Annualized PiB-PET accumulation [global ΔPiB(log)/year] was estimated by the difference between the second and first log-transformed global PiB-PET uptake estimations divided by the interval between scans (years). Sixty-four participants were included in SWA analysis. SWA was characterized by the mean relative spectral power density (%) in slow oscillation (SO: 0.5-0.9 Hz) and delta (1-3.9 Hz) frequency bands and by their downslopes (SO-slope and delta-slope, respectively) during the diagnostic portion of polysomnography. We fit linear regression models to test for associations among global ΔPiB(log)/year, SWA features (mean SO% and delta% or mean SO-slope and delta-slope), and OSA severity markers, after adjusting for age at baseline PiB-PET,	Alzheimer’s disease; amyloid; obstructive sleep apnoea; sleep; slow-wave activity

Comparison of brief olfactory and cognitive assessments to neuroimaging biomarkers in the prediction of cognitive decline and dementia in the MCSA cohort.	INTRODUCTION: We evaluated impaired odor identification and global cognition as simple, cost-effective alternatives to neuroimaging biomarkers to predict cognitive decline and dementia in the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging. METHODS: Six hundred forty-seven participants (mean 8.1, standard deviation 3.4 years' follow-up) had the following baseline procedures: modified Blessed Information Memory Concentration Test (BIMCT), 12-item Brief Smell Identification Test (BSIT), structural brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and positron emission tomography (PET) imaging with 11C-Pittsburgh compound B (11C-PiB) and fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG; subset). RESULTS: Cognitive decline developed in 102 participants and dementia in 34 participants. In survival analyses, PiB PET showed robust prediction for cognitive decline. Impaired BSIT, impaired BIMCT, MRI, and FDG measures were also significant predictors. The combination of demographics + BSIT + BIMCT showed strong predictive utility (C-index 0.81), similar to demographics + PiB PET (C-index 0.80). Similar but stronger results were obtained for prediction of dementia. DISCUSSION: Impairment in both odor identification test and global cognition was comparable to PiB PET for predicting cognitive decline and dementia. HIGHLIGHTS: In 647 participants in the population-based Mayo Clinic Study of Aging, several clinical markers and biomarkers each predicted cognitive decline or dementia during an average 8 years of follow-up. The combination of the demographic variables of age, sex, and education with a brief odor identification test (BSIT) and a global cognitive test (Blessed Information Memory Concentration Test) showed strong predictive utility (C-index 0.81) for cognitive decline that was similar to the demographic variables combined with Pittsburgh Compound B amyloid imaging (C-index 0.80). Combining a brief odor identification test with a brief cognitive test needs consideration as a simple, cost-effective option in the clinical assessment of individuals at risk of cognitive decline and dementia, as well as a potential tool to identify individuals who may benefit from disease-modifying treatments and to screen participants for prevention trials.	amyloid imaging; cognition; cognitive decline; dementia; olfaction; positron emission tomography

Continuous Associations between Remote Self-Administered Cognitive Measures and Imaging Biomarkers of Alzheimer's Disease.	BACKGROUND: Easily accessible and self-administered cognitive assessments that can aid early detection for Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia risk are critical for timely intervention. OBJECTIVES/DESIGN: This cross-sectional study investigated continuous associations between Mayo Test Drive (MTD) - a remote, self-administered, multi-device compatible, web-based cognitive assessment - and AD-related imaging biomarkers. PARTICIPANTS/SETTING: 684 adults from the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging and Mayo Clinic Alzheimer's Disease Research Center participated (age=70.4±11.2, 49.7% female). Participants were predominantly cognitively unimpaired (CU; 94.0%). MEASUREMENTS: Participants completed (1) brain amyloid and tau PET scans and MRI scans for hippocampal volume (HV) and white matter hyperintensities (WMH); (2) MTD remotely, consisting of the Stricker Learning Span and Symbols Test which combine into an MTD composite; and (3) in-person neuropsychological assessment including measures to obtain Mayo Preclinical Alzheimer's disease Cognitive Composite (Mayo-PACC) and Global-z. Multiple regressions adjusted for age, sex, and education queried associations between imaging biomarkers and scores from remote and in-person cognitive measures. RESULTS: Lower performances on MTD were associated with greater amyloid, entorhinal tau, and global tau PET burden, lower HV, and higher WMH. Mayo-PACC and Global-z were associated with all imaging biomarkers except global tau PET burden. MCI/Dementia participants showed lower performance on all MTD measures compared to CU with large effect sizes (Hedge's g's=1.65-2.02), with similar findings for CU versus MCI only (Hedge's g's=1.46-1.83). CONCLUSION: MTD is associated with continuous measures of AD-related imaging biomarkers, demonstrating ability to detect subtle cognitive change using a brief, remote assessment in predominantly CU individuals and criterion validity for MTD.

Can integration of Alzheimer's plasma biomarkers with MRI, cardiovascular, genetics, and lifestyle measures improve cognition prediction?	There is increasing interest in Alzheimer's disease related plasma biomarkers due to their accessibility and scalability. We hypothesized that integrating plasma biomarkers with other commonly used and available participant data (MRI, cardiovascular factors, lifestyle, genetics) using machine learning (ML) models can improve individual prediction of cognitive outcomes. Further, our goal was to evaluate the heterogeneity of these predictors across different age strata. This longitudinal study included 1185 participants from the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging who had complete plasma analyte work-up at baseline.

Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography Retinal Imaging Associations With Burden of Small Vessel Disease and Amyloid Positivity in the Brain.	BACKGROUND: Alzheimer disease (AD) and other dementias are associated with vascular changes and amyloid deposition, which may be reflected as density changes in the retinal capillaries. These changes may can be directly visualized and quantified with optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA), making OCTA a potential noninvasive preclinical biomarker of small vessel disease and amyloid positivity. Our objective was to investigate the feasibility of retinal imaging metrics as noninvasive biomarkers of small vessel disease and amyloid positivity in the brain. METHODS: We investigated associations between OCTA and neuroimaging and cognitive metrics in 41 participants without dementia from the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging and Alzheimer's Disease Research Center. OCTA metrics included superficial, deep, and full retina capillary density of the fovea, parafovea, and macula as well as the area of the foveal avascular zone (FAZ). Neuroimaging metrics included a high burden of white matter hyperintensity (WMH), presence of cerebral microbleeds (CMB), lacunar infarcts, and amyloid positivity as evidenced on positron emission tomography (PET), whereas cognitive metrics included mini-mental status examination (MMSE) score. We performed generalized estimating equations to account for measurements in each eye while controlling for age and sex to estimate associations between OCTA metrics and neuroimaging and cognitive scores. RESULTS: Associations between OCTA and neuroimaging metrics were restricted to the fovea. OCTA showed decreased capillary density with high burden of WMH in both the superficial ( P = 0.003), deep ( P = 0.004), and full retina ( P = 0.01) in the fovea but not the parafovea or whole macula. Similarly, participants with amyloid PET positivity had significantly decreased capillary density in the superficial fovea ( P = 0.027) and deep fovea ( P = 0.03) but higher density in the superficial parafovea ( P = 0.038). Participants with amyloid PET positivity also had a significantly larger FAZ ( P = 0.031), whereas in those with high WMH burden the difference did not reach statistical significance ( P = 0.075). There was also a positive association between MMSE and capillary density of the full retina within the fovea ( P = 0.037) and in the superficial parafovea ( P = 0.046). No associations were found between OCTA metrics and presence of CMB or presence of lacunar infarcts. CONCLUSIONS: The associations of lower foveal capillary density with cerebral WMH and amyloid positivity suggest that further research is warranted to evaluate for shared mechanisms of disease between small vessel disease and AD pathologies.

Can white matter hyperintensities based Fazekas visual assessment scales inform about Alzheimer's disease pathology in the population?	BACKGROUND: White matter hyperintensities (WMH) are considered hallmark features of cerebral small vessel disease and have recently been linked to Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. Their distinct spatial distributions, namely periventricular versus deep WMH, may differ by underlying age-related and pathobiological processes contributing to cognitive decline. We aimed to identify the spatial patterns of WMH using the 4-scale Fazekas visual assessment and explore their differential association with age, vascular health, AD imaging markers, namely amyloid and tau burden, and cognition. Because our study consisted of scans from GE and Siemens scanners with different resolutions, we also investigated inter-scanner reproducibility and combinability of WMH measurements on imaging. METHODS: We identified 1144 participants from the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging consisting of a population-based sample from Olmsted County, Minnesota with available structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), amyloid, and tau positron emission tomography (PET). WMH distribution patterns were assessed on FLAIR-MRI, both 2D axial and 3D, using Fazekas ratings of periventricular and deep WMH severity. We compared the association of periventricular and deep WMH scales with vascular risk factors, amyloid-PET, and tau-PET standardized uptake value ratio, automated WMH volume, and cognition using Pearson partial correlation after adjusting for age. We also evaluated vendor compatibility and reproducibility of the Fazekas scales using intraclass correlations (ICC). RESULTS: Periventricular and deep WMH measurements showed similar correlations with age, cardiometabolic conditions score (vascular risk), and cognition, (p < 0.001). Both periventricular WMH and deep WMH showed weak associations with amyloidosis (R = 0.07, p = < 0.001), and none with tau burden. We found substantial agreement between data from the two scanners for Fazekas measurements (ICC = 0.82 and 0.74). The automated WMH volume had high discriminating power for identifying participants with Fazekas ≥ 2 (area under curve = 0.97) and showed poor correlation with amyloid and tau PET markers similar to the visual grading. CONCLUSION: Our study investigated risk factors underlying WMH spatial patterns and their impact on global cognition, with no discernible differences between periventricular and deep WMH. We observed minimal impact of amyloidosis on WMH severity. These findings, coupled with enhanced inter-scanner reproducibility of WMH data, suggest the combinability of inter-scanner data assessed by harmonized protocols in the context of vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia biomarker research.

Longitudinal associations of reproductive factors and exogeneous estrogens with neuroimaging biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease and cerebrovascular disease.	INTRODUCTION: Female-specific reproductive factors and exogeneous estrogen use are associated with cognition in later life. However, the underlying mechanisms are not understood. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of reproductive factors on neuroimaging biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and cerebrovascular pathologies. METHODS: We evaluated 389 females (median age of 71.7 years) enrolled in the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging with reproductive history data and longitudinal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. We used linear mixed effect models to examine the associations between reproductive factors and changes in neuroimaging measures. RESULTS: Ever hormonal contraception (HC) use was longitudinally associated with higher fractional anisotropy across the corpus callosum, lower white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volume, and greater cortical thickness in an AD meta-region of interest (ROI). The initiation of menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) > 5 years post menopause was associated with higher WMH volume. DISCUSSION: HC use and initiation of MHT >5 years post menopause were generally associated with neuroimaging biomarkers of cerebrovascular pathologies. HIGHLIGHTS: Hormonal contraception use was associated with better brain white matter (WM) integrity. Initiation of menopausal hormone therapy >5 years post menopause was associated with worsening brain WM integrity. Hormonal contraception use was associated with greater cortical thickness. Ages at menarche and menopause and number of pregnancies were not associated with imaging measures. There were few associations between reproductive factors or exogenous estrogens and amyloid or tau PET.

TDP-43 Is Associated with Subiculum and Cornu Ammonis 1 Hippocampal Subfield Atrophy in Primary Age-Related Tauopathy.	BACKGROUND: TAR DNA binding protein 43 (TDP-43) has been shown to be associated with whole hippocampal atrophy in primary age-related tauopathy (PART). It is currently unknown which subregions of the hippocampus are contributing to TDP-43 associated whole hippocampal atrophy in PART. OBJECTIVE: To identify which specific hippocampal subfield regions are contributing to TDP-43-associated whole hippocampal atrophy in PART. METHODS: A total of 115 autopsied cases from the Mayo Clinic Alzheimer Disease Research Center, Neurodegenerative Research Group, and the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging were analyzed. All cases underwent antemortem brain volumetric MRI, neuropathological assessment of the distribution of Aβ (Thal phase), and neurofibrillary tangle (Braak stage) to diagnose PART, as well as assessment of TDP-43 presence/absence in the amygdala, hippocampus and beyond. Hippocampal subfield segmentation was performed using FreeSurfer version 7.4.1. Statistical analyses using logistic regression were performed to assess for associations between TDP-43 and hippocampal subfield volumes, accounting for potential confounders. RESULTS: TDP-43 positive patients (n = 37, 32%), of which 15/15 were type-α, had significantly smaller whole hippocampal volumes, and smaller volumes of the body and tail of the hippocampus compared to TDP-43 negative patients. Subfield analyses revealed an association between TDP-43 and the molecular layer of hippocampal body and the body of cornu ammonis 1 (CA1), subiculum, and presubiculum regions. There was no association between TDP-43 stage and subfield volumes. CONCLUSIONS: Whole hippocampal volume loss linked to TDP-43 in PART is mainly due to volume loss occurring in the molecular layer, CA1, subiculum and presubiculum of the hippocampal body.

Boston Criteria v2.0 for Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy Without Hemorrhage: An MRI-Neuropathologic Validation Study.	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Updated criteria for the clinical-MRI diagnosis of cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) have recently been proposed. However, their performance in individuals without symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) presentations is less defined. We aimed to assess the diagnostic performance of the Boston criteria version 2.0 for CAA diagnosis in a cohort of individuals ranging from cognitively normal to dementia in the community and memory clinic settings. METHODS: Fifty-four participants from the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging or Alzheimer's Disease Research Center were included if they had an antemortem MRI with gradient-recall echo sequences and a brain autopsy with CAA evaluation. Performance of the Boston criteria v2.0 was compared with v1.5 using histopathologically verified CAA as the reference standard. RESULTS: The median age at MRI was 75 years (interquartile range 65-80) with 28/54 participants having histopathologically verified CAA (i.e., moderate-to-severe CAA in at least 1 lobar region). The sensitivity and specificity of the Boston criteria v2.0 were 28.6% (95% CI 13.2%-48.7%) and 65.3% (95% CI 44.3%-82.8%) for probable CAA diagnosis (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC] 0.47) and 75.0% (55.1-89.3) and 38.5% (20.2-59.4) for any CAA diagnosis (possible + probable; AUC 0.57), respectively. The v2.0 Boston criteria were not superior in performance compared with the prior v1.5 criteria for either CAA diagnostic category. DISCUSSION: The Boston criteria v2.0 have low accuracy in patients who are asymptomatic or only have cognitive symptoms. Additional biomarkers need to be explored to optimize CAA diagnosis in this population.

Comparison of plasma biomarkers and amyloid PET for predicting memory decline in cognitively unimpaired individuals.	BACKGROUND: We compared the ability of several plasma biomarkers versus amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) to predict rates of memory decline among cognitively unimpaired individuals. METHODS: We studied 645 Mayo Clinic Study of Aging participants. Predictor variables were age, sex, education, apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 genotype, amyloid PET, and plasma amyloid beta (Aβ)42/40, phosphorylated tau (p-tau)181, neurofilament light (NfL), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and p-tau217. The outcome was a change in a memory composite measure. RESULTS: All plasma biomarkers, except NfL, were associated with mean memory decline in models with individual biomarkers. However, amyloid PET and plasma p-tau217, along with age, were key variables independently associated with mean memory decline in models combining all predictors. Confidence intervals were narrow for estimates of population mean prediction, but person-level prediction intervals were wide. DISCUSSION: Plasma p-tau217 and amyloid PET provide useful information about predicting rates of future cognitive decline in cognitively unimpaired individuals at the population mean level, but not at the individual person level.	amyloid PET; cognitive decline; cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease; plasma biomarkers and Alzheimer's disease

Machine Learning Models of Polygenic Risk for Enhanced Prediction of Alzheimer Disease Endophenotypes.	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Alzheimer disease (AD) has a polygenic architecture, for which genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have helped elucidate sequence variants (SVs) influencing susceptibility. Polygenic risk score (PRS) approaches show promise for generating summary measures of inherited risk for clinical AD based on the effects of METHODS: We analyzed combined data from the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging (n = 1,791) and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (n = 864). An AD PRS was computed for each participant using the top common SVs obtained from a large AD dementia GWAS. In parallel, ML models were trained using those SV genotypes, with amyloid PET burden as the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes included amyloid PET positivity and clinical diagnosis (cognitively unimpaired vs impaired). We compared performance between ML-PRS and standard PRS across 100 training sessions with different data splits. In each session, data were split into 80% training and 20% testing, and then five-fold cross-validation was used within the training set to ensure the best model was produced for testing. We also applied permutation importance techniques to assess which genetic factors contributed most to outcome prediction. RESULTS: ML-PRS models outperformed the AD PRS ( DISCUSSION: We found that ML-PRS approaches improved upon standard PRS for prediction of AD endophenotypes, partly related to improved accounting for nonlinear effects of genetic susceptibility alleles. Further adaptations of the ML-PRS framework could help to close the gap of remaining unexplained heritability for AD and therefore facilitate more accurate presymptomatic and early-stage risk stratification for clinical decision-making.

Neuroimaging Characteristics of Hearing Loss in the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging.	OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between standard pure tone and speech audiometry with neuroimaging characteristics reflective of aging and dementia in older adults. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective population-based study. SETTING: Single tertiary care referral center. METHODS: Participants from the Mayo Clinic Study of aging 60 years old or older with normal cognition or mild cognitive impairment, baseline neuroimaging, and a behavioral audiogram associated with neuroimaging were eligible for study. Imaging modalities included structural MRI (sMRI) and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery MRI (FLAIR-MRI; N = 605), diffusion tensor imaging MRI (DTI-MRI; N = 444), and fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET; N = 413). Multivariable logistic and linear regression models were used to evaluate associations with neuroimaging outcomes. RESULTS: Mean (SD) pure tone average (PTA) was 33 (15) dB HL and mean (SD) word recognition score (WRS) was 91% (14). There were no significant associations between audiometric performance and cortical thinning assessed by sMRI. Each 10-dB increase in PTA was associated with increased likelihood of abnormal white-matter hyperintensity (WMH) from FLAIR-MRI (odds ratio 1.26, P = .02). From DTI-MRI, participants with <100% WRSs had significantly lower fractional anisotropy in the genu of the corpus callosum (parameter estimate [PE] -0.012, P = .008) compared to those with perfect WRSs. From FDG-PET, each 10% decrease in WRSs was associated with decreased uptake in the anterior cingulate cortex (PE -0.013, P = .001). CONCLUSION: Poorer audiometric performance was not significantly associated with cortical thinning but was associated with white matter damage relevant to cerebrovascular disease (increased abnormal WMH, decreased corpus callosum diffusion). These neuroimaging results suggest a pathophysiologic link between hearing loss and cerebrovascular disease.	dementia; hearing loss; mild cognitive impairment; neuroimaging

BACKGROUND: Updated criteria for the clinical-MRI diagnosis of cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) have recently been proposed. However, their performance in individuals without intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) or transient focal neurological episodes (TFNE) is unknown. We assessed the diagnostic performance of the Boston criteria version 2.0 for CAA diagnosis in a cohort of individuals presenting without symptomatic ICH. METHODS: Fifty-four participants from the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging or Alzheimer's Disease Research Center were included if they had an antemortem MRI with gradient-recall echo sequences and a brain autopsy with CAA evaluation. Performance of the Boston criteria v2.0 was compared to v1.5 using histopathologically verified CAA as the reference standard. RESULTS: Median age at MRI was 75 years (IQR 65-80) with 28/54 participants having histopathologically verified CAA (i.e., moderate-to-severe CAA in at least 1 lobar region). The sensitivity and specificity of the Boston criteria v2.0 were 28.6% (95%CI: 13.2-48.7%) and 65.3% (95%CI: 44.3-82.8%) for probable CAA diagnosis (AUC 0.47) and 75.0% (55.1-89.3) and 38.5% (20.2-59.4) for any CAA diagnosis (possible + probable; AUC: 0.57), respectively. The v2.0 Boston criteria was not superior in performance compared to the prior v1.5 criteria for either CAA diagnostic category. CONCLUSIONS: The Boston criteria v2.0 have low accuracy in patients who are asymptomatic or only have cognitive symptoms.. Additional biomarkers need to be explored to optimize CAA diagnosis in this population.

Modeling the temporal evolution of plasma p-tau in relation to amyloid beta and tau PET.	INTRODUCTION: The timing of plasma biomarker changes is not well understood. The goal of this study was to evaluate the temporal co-evolution of plasma and positron emission tomography (PET) Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers. METHODS: We included 1408 Mayo Clinic Study of Aging and Alzheimer's Disease Research Center participants. An accelerated failure time (AFT) model was fit with amyloid beta (Aβ) PET, tau PET, plasma p-tau217, p-tau181, and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) as endpoints. RESULTS: Individual timing of plasma p-tau progression was strongly associated with Aβ PET and GFAP progression. In the population, GFAP became abnormal first, then Aβ PET, plasma p-tau, and tau PET temporal meta-regions of interest when applying cut points based on young, cognitively unimpaired participants. DISCUSSION: Plasma p-tau is a stronger indicator of a temporally linked response to elevated brain Aβ than of tau pathology. While Aβ deposition and a rise in GFAP are upstream events associated with tau phosphorylation, the temporal link between p-tau and Aβ PET was the strongest. HIGHLIGHTS: Plasma p-tau progression was more strongly associated with Aβ than tau PET. Progression on plasma p-tau was associated with Aβ PET and GFAP progression. P-tau181 and p-tau217 become abnormal after Aβ PET and before tau PET. GFAP became abnormal first, before plasma p-tau and Aβ PET.

Bayesian workflow for the investigation of hierarchical classification models from tau-PET and structural MRI data across the Alzheimer's disease spectrum.	BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis in its early stages remains difficult with current diagnostic approaches. Though tau neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) generally follow the stereotypical pattern described by the Braak staging scheme, the network degeneration hypothesis (NDH) has suggested that NFTs spread selectively along functional networks of the brain. To evaluate this, we implemented a Bayesian workflow to develop hierarchical multinomial logistic regression models with increasing levels of complexity of the brain from tau-PET and structural MRI data to investigate whether it is beneficial to incorporate network-level information into an ROI-based predictive model for the presence/absence of AD. METHODS: This study included data from the Translational Biomarkers in Aging and Dementia (TRIAD) longitudinal cohort from McGill University's Research Centre for Studies in Aging (MCSA). Baseline and 1 year follow-up structural MRI and [ RESULTS: The Bayesian leave-one-out cross-validation (LOO-CV) estimate of the expected log pointwise predictive density (ELPD) results indicated that models 3 and 4 were substantially better than other models for both tau-PET and structural MRI inputs. For tau-PET data, model 3 was slightly better than 4 with an absolute difference in ELPD of 3.10 ± 1.30. For structural MRI data, model 4 was considerably better than other models with an absolute difference in ELPD of 29.83 ± 7.55 relative to model 3, the second-best model. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that representing the data generating process in terms of a hierarchical model that encompasses both ROI-level and network-level heterogeneity leads to better predictive ability for both tau-PET and structural MRI inputs over all other model iterations.

Cognitive Performance, Sociodemographic Factors, Pure-Tone Audiometry, and their Association with Speech Discrimination: A Prospective Population-Based Study of 1,061 Older Adults.	OBJECTIVE: Hearing loss is increasingly recognized as a chronic disease state with important health sequelae. Although considered a central component of routine audiometric testing, the degree to which various patient factors influence speech discrimination is poorly characterized to date. The primary objective of the current work was to describe associations of cognitive performance, sociodemographic factors, and pure-tone audiometry with speech discrimination in older adults. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective study. SETTING: Olmsted County, Minnesota. PATIENTS: There were 1,061 study participants 50 years or older at enrollment in the population-based Mayo Clinic Study of Aging between November 2004 and December 2019 who underwent formal audiometric and cognitive testing included in the current investigation. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome measure was word recognition scores (WRSs; measured as <100% vs 100% as well as continuous), with pure-tone averages (PTAs; 0.5, 1, 2, and 3 kHz), age, sex, years of education, state area deprivation index (ADI) quintiles, and global cognition z scores as explanatory features. RESULTS: The mean (SD) age among the 1,061 participants was 76 (9) years with 528 (50%) males. Participant age [OR (95% CI) for a 10-year increase of 1.8 (1.4-2.3), p < 0.001], male sex [OR = 2.6 (1.9-3.7), p < 0.001], and PTA [OR for a 10-dB hearing loss increase of 2.4 (2.1-2.8), p < 0.001] were all significantly associated with <100% WRSs, with the greatest explanatory ability attributable to the PTA. Years of education ( p = 0.9), state ADI quintile ( p = 0.6), and global cognitive performance ( p = 0.2) were not associated with WRS. The multivariable model demonstrated strong predictive ability for less than perfect WRSs, with a c index of 0.854. Similar results were seen for WRSs analyzed as continuous, with the multivariable model resulting in an R2 value of 0.433. CONCLUSIONS: Although PTA exhibited the greatest influence on speech discrimination, advancing age and male sex both independently increased the likelihood of having worse speech discrimination among older adults, even after accounting for years of education, neighborhood-level socioeconomic disadvantage, and cognitive function. These findings help identify patient factors that can be instrumental when designing screening programs for adult-onset hearing loss.

Association of the fibronectin type III domain-containing protein 5 rs1746661 single nucleotide polymorphism with reduced brain glucose metabolism in elderly humans.	Fibronectin type III domain-containing protein 5 (FNDC5) and its derived hormone, irisin, have been associated with metabolic control in humans, with described FNDC5 single nucleotide polymorphisms being linked to obesity and metabolic syndrome. Decreased brain FNDC5/irisin has been reported in subjects with dementia due to Alzheimer's disease. Since impaired brain glucose metabolism develops in ageing and is prominent in Alzheimer's disease, here, we examined associations of a single nucleotide polymorphism in the FNDC5 gene (rs1746661) with brain glucose metabolism and amyloid-β deposition in a cohort of 240 cognitively unimpaired and 485 cognitively impaired elderly individuals from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. In cognitively unimpaired elderly individuals harbouring the FNDC5 rs1746661(T) allele, we observed a regional reduction in low glucose metabolism in memory-linked brain regions and increased brain amyloid-β PET load.

Eligibility for Anti-Amyloid Treatment in a Population-Based Study of Cognitive Aging.	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Treatment options for Alzheimer disease (AD) are limited and have focused mainly on symptomatic therapy and improving quality of life. Recently, lecanemab, an anti-β-amyloid monoclonal antibody (mAb), received accelerated approval by the US Food and Drug Administration for treatment in the early stages of biomarker-confirmed symptomatic AD. An additional anti-β-amyloid mAb, aducanumab, was approved in 2021, and more will potentially become available in the near future. Research on the applicability and generalizability of the anti-β-amyloid mAb eligibility criteria on adults with biomarkers available in the general population has been lacking. The study's primary aim was to apply the clinical trial eligibility criteria for lecanemab treatment to participants with early AD of the population-based Mayo Clinic Study of Aging (MCSA) and assess the generalizability of anti-amyloid treatment. The secondary aim of this study was to apply the clinical trial eligibility criteria for aducanumab treatment in MCSA participants. METHODS: This cross-sectional study aimed to apply the clinical trial eligibility criteria for lecanemab and aducanumab treatment to participants with early AD of the population-based MCSA and assess the generalizability of anti-amyloid treatment. RESULTS: Two hundred thirty-seven MCSA participants (mean age [SD] 80.9 [6.3] years, 54.9% male, and 97.5% White) with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or mild dementia and increased brain amyloid burden by PiB PET comprised the study sample. Lecanemab trial's inclusion criteria reduced the study sample to 112 (47.3% of 237) participants. The trial's exclusion criteria further narrowed the number of potentially eligible participants to 19 (overall 8% of 237). Modifying the eligibility criteria to include all participants with MCI (instead of applying additional cognitive criteria) resulted in 17.4% of participants with MCI being eligible for lecanemab treatment. One hundred four participants (43.9% of 237) fulfilled the aducanumab clinical trial's inclusion criteria. The aducanumab trial's exclusion criteria further reduced the number of available participants, narrowing those eligible to 12 (5.1% of 237). Common exclusions were related to other chronic conditions and neuroimaging findings. DISCUSSION: Findings estimate the limited eligibility in typical older adults with cognitive impairment for anti-β-amyloid mAbs.

Evidence against a temporal association between cerebrovascular disease and Alzheimer's disease imaging biomarkers.	Whether a relationship exists between cerebrovascular disease and Alzheimer's disease has been a source of controversy. Evaluation of the temporal progression of imaging biomarkers of these disease processes may inform mechanistic associations. We investigate the relationship of disease trajectories of cerebrovascular disease (white matter hyperintensity, WMH, and fractional anisotropy, FA) and Alzheimer's disease (amyloid and tau PET) biomarkers in 2406 Mayo Clinic Study of Aging and Mayo Alzheimer's Disease Research Center participants using accelerated failure time models. The model assumes a common pattern of progression for each biomarker that is shifted earlier or later in time for each individual and represented by a per participant age adjustment. An individual's amyloid and tau PET adjustments show very weak temporal association with WMH and FA adjustments (R = -0.07 to 0.07); early/late amyloid or tau timing explains <1% of the variation in WMH and FA adjustment. Earlier onset of amyloid is associated with earlier onset of tau (R = 0.57, R

Association of Polysomnographic Sleep Parameters With Neuroimaging Biomarkers of Cerebrovascular Disease in Older Adults With Sleep Apnea.	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Our objective was to determine whether polysomnographic (PSG) sleep parameters are associated with neuroimaging biomarkers of cerebrovascular disease (CVD) related to white matter (WM) integrity in older adults with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). METHODS: From the population-based Mayo Clinic Study of Aging, we identified participants without dementia who underwent at least 1 brain MRI and PSG. We quantified 2 CVD biomarkers: WM hyperintensities (WMHs) from fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR)-MRI, and fractional anisotropy of the genu of the corpus callosum (genu FA) from diffusion MRI. For this cross-sectional analysis, we fit linear models to assess associations between PSG parameters (NREM stage 1 percentage, NREM stage 3 percentage [slow-wave sleep], mean oxyhemoglobin saturation, and log of apnea-hypopnea index [AHI]) and CVD biomarkers (log of WMH and log of genu FA), respectively, while adjusting for age (at MRI), sex, RESULTS: We included 140 participants with FLAIR-MRI (of which 103 had additional diffusion MRI). The mean ± SD age was 72.7 ± 9.6 years at MRI with nearly 60% being men. The absolute median (interquartile range [IQR]) interval between MRI and PSG was 1.74 (0.9-3.2) years. 90.7% were cognitively unimpaired (CU) during both assessments. For every 10-point decrease in N3%, there was a 0.058 (95% CI 0.006-0.111, DISCUSSION: We found that reduced slow-wave sleep and severe OSA were associated with higher burden of WM abnormalities in predominantly CU older adults, which may contribute to greater risk of cognitive impairment, dementia, and stroke. Our study supports the association between sleep depth/fragmentation and intermittent hypoxia and CVD biomarkers. Longitudinal studies are required to assess causation.

Interactions Between Neuropsychiatric Symptoms and Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Biomarkers in Predicting Longitudinal Cognitive Decline.	OBJECTIVE: To examine interactions between Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) with Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB) and fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) in predicting cognitive trajectories. METHODS: We conducted a longitudinal study in the setting of the population-based Mayo Clinic Study of Aging in Olmsted County, MN, involving 1581 cognitively unimpaired (CU) persons aged ≥50 years (median age 71.83 years, 54.0% males, 27.5% APOE ɛ4 carriers). NPS at baseline were assessed using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire (NPI-Q). Brain glucose hypometabolism was defined as a SUVR ≤ 1.47 (measured by FDG-PET) in regions typically affected in Alzheimer's disease. Abnormal cortical amyloid deposition was measured using PiB-PET (SUVR ≥ 1.48). Neuropsychological testing was done approximately every 15 months, and we calculated global and domain-specific (memory, language, attention, and visuospatial skills) cognitive z-scores. We ran linear mixed-effect models to examine the associations and interactions between NPS at baseline and z-scored PiB- and FDG-PET SUVRs in predicting cognitive z-scores adjusted for age, sex, education, and previous cognitive testing. RESULTS: Individuals at the average PiB and without NPS at baseline declined over time on cognitive z-scores. Those with increased PiB at baseline declined faster (two-way interaction), and those with increased PiB and NPS declined even faster (three-way interaction). We observed interactions between time, increased PiB and anxiety or irritability indicating accelerated decline on global z-scores, and between time, increased PiB and several NPS (e.g., agitation) showing faster domain-specific decline, especially on the attention domain. CONCLUSIONS: NPS and increased brain amyloid deposition synergistically interact in accelerating global and domain-specific cognitive decline among CU persons at baseline.

INTRODUCTION: In Alzheimer's disease clinical research, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) released/leaked into the cerebrospinal fluid and blood is widely measured and perceived as a biomarker of reactive astrogliosis. However, it was demonstrated that GFAP levels differ in individuals presenting with amyloid-β (Aβ) or tau pathologies. The molecular underpinnings behind this specificity are little explored. Here we investigated biomarker and transcriptomic associations of hippocampal GFAP-positive astrocytes with Aβ and tau pathologies in humans and mouse models. METHODS: We studied 90 individuals with plasma GFAP, Aβ- and Tau-PET to investigate the association between biomarkers. Then, transcriptomic analysis in hippocampal GFAP-positive astrocytes isolated from mouse models presenting Aβ (PS2APP) or tau (P301S) pathologies was conducted to explore differentially expressed genes (DEGs), Gene Ontology terms, and protein-protein interaction networks associated with each phenotype. RESULTS: In humans, we found that plasma GFAP associates with Aβ but not tau pathology. Unveiling the unique nature of hippocampal GFAP-positive astrocytic responses to Aβ or tau pathologies, mouse transcriptomics showed scarce overlap of DEGs between the Aβ. and tau mouse models. While Aβ GFAP-positive astrocytes were overrepresented with DEGs associated with proteostasis and exocytosis-related processes, tau hippocampal GFAP-positive astrocytes presented greater abnormalities in functions related to DNA/RNA processing and cytoskeleton dynamics. CONCLUSION: Our results offer insights into Aβ- and tau-driven specific signatures in hippocampal GFAP-positive astrocytes. Characterizing how different underlying pathologies distinctly influence astrocyte responses is critical for the biological interpretation of astrocyte biomarkers and suggests the need to develop context-specific astrocyte targets to study AD.

Associations of Neurodegeneration Biomarkers in Cerebrospinal Fluid with Markers of Alzheimer's Disease and Vascular Pathology.	BACKGROUND: The National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer's Association Research Framework proposes defining Alzheimer's disease by grouping imaging and fluid biomarkers by their respective pathologic processes. The AT(N) structure proposes several neurodegenerative fluid biomarkers (N) including total tau (t-tau), neurogranin (Ng), and neurofilament light chain (NfL). However, pathologic drivers influencing each biomarker remain unclear. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-neurodegenerative biomarkers (N) map differentially to Alzheimer's disease pathology measured by Aβ42 (an indicator of amyloidosis, [A]), p-tau (an indicator of tau deposition, [T]), and MRI vascular pathology indicators (measured by white-matter integrity, infarcts, and microbleeds [V]). METHODS: Participants were from Mayo Clinic Study of Aging (MCSA) with CSF measures of NfL, Ng, t-tau, Aβ42, and p-tau and available MRI brain imaging. Linear models assessed associations between CSF neurodegeneration (N) markers, amyloid markers (A), tau (T), and vascular pathology (V). RESULTS: Participants (n = 408) had a mean age of 69.2±10.7; male, 217 (53.2%); cognitively unimpaired, 359 (88%). All three neurodegeneration biomarkers correlated with age (p < 0.001 for NfL and t-tau, p = 0.018 for Ng). Men had higher CSF-NfL levels; women had higher Ng (p < 0.001). NfL and t-tau levels correlated with infarcts (p = 0.009, p = 0.034 respectively); no biomarkers correlated with white-matter integrity. N biomarkers correlated with p-tau levels (T, p < 0.001). Higher Aβ42 levels associated with higher N-biomarker levels but only among cognitively unimpaired (A, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The influence of vascular pathology in the general population on CSF (N) biomarkers is modest, with greater influence of infarcts than white-matter disruption. Neurodegeneration markers more closely correlated with tau than amyloid markers.

Predicting amyloid PET and tau PET stages with plasma biomarkers.	Staging the severity of Alzheimer's disease pathology using biomarkers is useful for therapeutic trials and clinical prognosis. Disease staging with amyloid and tau PET has face validity; however, this would be more practical with plasma biomarkers. Our objectives were, first, to examine approaches for staging amyloid and tau PET and, second, to examine prediction of amyloid and tau PET stages using plasma biomarkers. Participants (n = 1136) were enrolled in either the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging or the Alzheimer's Disease Research Center; had a concurrent amyloid PET, tau PET and blood draw; and met clinical criteria for cognitively unimpaired (n = 864), mild cognitive impairment (n = 148) or Alzheimer's clinical syndrome with dementia (n = 124). The latter two groups were combined into a cognitively impaired group (n = 272). We used multinomial regression models to estimate discrimination [concordance (C) statistics] among three amyloid PET stages (low, intermediate, high), four tau PET stages (Braak 0, 1-2, 3-4, 5-6) and a combined amyloid and tau PET stage (none/low versus intermediate/high severity) using plasma biomarkers as predictors separately within unimpaired and impaired individuals. Plasma analytes, p-tau181, Aβ1-42 and Aβ1-40 (analysed as the Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio), glial fibrillary acidic protein and neurofilament light chain were measured on the HD-X Simoa Quanterix platform. Plasma p-tau217 was also measured in a subset (n = 355) of cognitively unimpaired participants using the Lilly Meso Scale Discovery assay. Models with all Quanterix plasma analytes along with risk factors (age, sex and APOE) most often provided the best discrimination among amyloid PET stages (C = 0.78-0.82). Models with p-tau181 provided similar discrimination of tau PET stages to models with all four plasma analytes (C = 0.72-0.85 versus C = 0.73-0.86). Discriminating a PET proxy of intermediate/high from none/low Alzheimer's disease neuropathological change with all four Quanterix plasma analytes was excellent but not better than p-tau181 only (C = 0.88 versus 0.87 for unimpaired and C = 0.91 versus 0.90 for impaired). Lilly p-tau217 outperformed the Quanterix p-tau181 assay for discriminating high versus intermediate amyloid (C = 0.85 versus 0.74) but did not improve over a model with all Quanterix plasma analytes and risk factors (C = 0.85 versus 0.83). Plasma analytes along with risk factors can discriminate between amyloid and tau PET stages and between a PET surrogate for intermediate/high versus none/low neuropathological change with accuracy in the acceptable to excellent range. Combinations of plasma analytes are better than single analytes for many staging predictions with the exception that Quanterix p-tau181 alone usually performed equivalently to combinations of Quanterix analytes for tau PET discrimination.

Association between hearing loss and development of dementia using formal behavioural audiometric testing within the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging (MCSA): a prospective population-based study.	BACKGROUND: Hearing loss has been identified as a potential major modifiable risk factor for developing dementia. This study examined associations between formal behavioural pure-tone and speech audiometry assessed by an audiologist with development of dementia in the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging (MCSA). METHODS: The MCSA is a prospective population-based study examining the incidence, prevalence, and risk factors of mild cognitive impairment and dementia in Olmsted County, Minnesota, USA. Participants undergo clinical examinations with neuropsychological testing at enrolment and every 15 months. Participants were 50 years or older at enrolment between Nov 29, 2004, and Dec 23, 2019, who underwent formal behavioural audiometric evaluation by an audiologist due to concerns about hearing loss or as a part of annual comprehensive health assessments. Associations of pure-tone average (PTA) and word recognition scores (WRS) with the development of dementia were evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression with age as the timescale, and associations with changes in cognitive testing scores over time were evaluated using linear mixed-effects models. FINDINGS: Among 1200 eligible participants, the mean age at enrolment was 79 years (SD 9), 593 (49%) were men, and 207 developed dementia during a mean of 7·0 years (SD 3·7) of follow-up. After adjusting for sex, years of education, smoking status, diabetes, hypertension, apolipoprotein E ε4 carriership, and hearing rehabilitation (defined as hearing aid or cochlear implant use), neither PTA (hazard ratio [HR] per 10-decibels hearing level increase of 0·99 (95% CI 0·89-1·12; p=0·91) nor WRS (HR per 10% decrease of 0·98, 95% CI 0·89-1 ·07; p=0·65) was significantly associated with the development of dementia. However, both PTA and WRS were significantly associated with poorer performance in cognitive testing over time: participants with a PTA higher than 25 decibels hearing level or a WRS lower than 100% had significantly worse declines in cognitive testing scores. Informant-based hearing difficulties assessed by the participant's study partner were significantly associated with the development of dementia (HR 1·95, 95% CI 1·45-2·62; p<0·0001). INTERPRETATION: In this prospective population-based study, subjective informant-based hearing difficulties were associated with development of dementia, whereas objective measures on formal behavioural audiometry were predictive of poorer performance on cognitive testing over time but not the development of dementia. Other factors related to central processing might potentiate the effects of peripheral hearing loss detected on behavioural audiometric testing.

Association of raloxifene and tamoxifen therapy with cognitive performance, odds of mild cognitive impairment, and brain MRI markers of neurodegeneration.	The aim of this cross-sectional study was to examine whether a history of selective estrogen receptor modifiers (SERMs), tamoxifen and raloxifene, use was associated with cognitive performance, odds of mild cognitive impairment (MCI), or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) markers of neurodegeneration associated with Alzheimer's disease. We included women with prior history of breast cancer or no prior history of any cancer at enrollment in the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging (MCSA). This information was abstracted using the Rochester Epidemiology Project medical-linkage system. Logistic regression was used to examine associations of SERMs with odds of MCI. Linear regression models were used to examine associations of SERMs with cognitive z-scores (Memory, Executive Function, Language, Visuospatial Skills, Global Cognition), and MRI markers. Among 2840 women aged 50 and older in the MCSA, 151 had a history of breast cancer, and 42 (28%) of these had a history of tamoxifen treatment. A total of 2235 women had no prior history of any cancer, and 76 (3%) of these had a history of raloxifene use. No significant associations between tamoxifen use and cognition, or odds of MCI were observed among women with a history of breast cancer after adjusting for confounders. Similarly, raloxifene use was not significantly associated with cognition, or odds of MCI in women without a history of cancer after adjusting for confounders. We did not find significant associations between the use of either SERM and MRI markers. Use of tamoxifen or raloxifene was not significantly associated with cognition in postmenopausal women.

Neuropathologic scales of cerebrovascular disease associated with diffusion changes on MRI.	Summarizing the multiplicity and heterogeneity of cerebrovascular disease (CVD) features into a single measure has been difficult in both neuropathology and imaging studies. The objective of this work was to evaluate the association between neuroimaging surrogates of CVD and two available neuropathologic CVD scales in those with both antemortem imaging CVD measures and postmortem CVD evaluation. Individuals in the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging with MRI scans within 5 years of death (N = 51) were included. Antemortem CVD measures were computed from diffusion MRI (dMRI), FLAIR, and T2* GRE imaging modalities and compared with postmortem neuropathologic findings using Kalaria and Strozyk Scales. Of all the neuroimaging measures, both regional and global dMRI measures were associated with Kalaria and Strozyk Scales (p < 0.05) and modestly correlated with global cognitive performance. The major conclusions from this study were: (i) microstructural white matter injury measurements using dMRI may be meaningful surrogates of neuropathologic CVD scales, because they aid in capturing diffuse (and early) changes to white matter and secondary neurodegeneration due to lesions; (ii) vacuolation in the corpus callosum may be associated with white matter changes measured on antemortem dMRI imaging; (iii) Alzheimer's disease neuropathologic change did not associate with neuropathologic CVD scales; and (iv) future work should be focused on developing better quantitative measures utilizing dMRI to optimally assess CVD-related neuropathologic changes.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by widespread molecular dysregulation, with the APOEe4 allele recognized as its strongest genetic risk factor. However, the mechanisms by which APOEe4 drives distinct molecular changes - whether by exacerbating pathology or triggering compensatory responses - remain incompletely understood. We generated and analyzed proteomic, epigenetic, and genetic data from post-mortem dorsolateral prefrontal cortex samples of a uniquely APOEe4-enriched subset of the Religious Orders Study and Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP). Specifically, we generated DIA LC-MS proteomic data (n = 302), analyzed previously generated DNA methylation profiles from our group (n = 310), and used published whole-genome sequencing data (n = 254) to compute polygenic risk scores (PRS). In this cohort, 69% (n = 214) were APOEe4 carriers, and 19.6% (n = 42) of them showed no pathological evidence of AD based on NIA-Reagan criteria, enabling identification of APOEe4-related risk and resilience mechanisms. In the absence of AD, APOEe4 carriers exhibited lower levels of 27 proteins, suggesting early synaptic (e.g., VAMP1, SYN3, CASKIN1) and metabolic (e.g., GLUD1, PI4KA) vulnerability. By contrast, APOEe4 carriers with AD displayed marked upregulation of inflammatory and proteostatic proteins (e.g., GNAO1, AHNAK, FGG, HEBP1, APEX1, RAB4A, SLC12A5, LRP1, BAG6) and hypermethylation of cg06329447 in ELAVL4. Network analyses highlighted convergent disruptions in synaptic transmission, metabolism, and proteostasis - key pathways altered in APOEe4-associated AD. Mediation analyses identified GRIPAP1 and GSTK1 as top protein mediators (accounting for ∼26-33% of APOEe4's effect), with VAMP1, CASKIN1, DPP3, SYN3, and FGG each contributing ∼9-15%. ELAVL4 hypermethylation also mediated ∼12% of the APOEe4 effect, linking epigenetic dysregulation to disease risk. To assess whether the identified proteins reflected broader genetic risk for AD or were specific to APOEe4, we calculated PRS both excluding and including the APOE genomic region. While the non-APOE PRS showed no association with identified molecular markers, the APOE-inclusive PRS was significantly associated with eight AD-related proteins in carriers, indicating they are not explained by polygenic risk outside of APOE. Finally, predictive modeling stratified by APOEe4 status revealed that in non-carriers, PRS most effectively classified AD (AUC = 0.73), whereas in carriers, proteomic and epigenetic markers outperformed PRS (AUC up to 0.74). Together, these findings demonstrate that APOEe4 confers AD risk through early synaptic and metabolic disruptions and later-stage inflammatory and epigenetic changes, laying the groundwork for genotype-tailored biomarker development and therapeutic strategies.

TAS2R38-Linked MGAM Expression in Alzheimer's Disease: A Novel Target for Precision Drug Repurposing.	OBJECTIVE: TAS2R38 is a taste receptor implicated in innate immunity. Identifying its genetic connection with Alzheimer's disease (AD) could aid in developing new drugs or repurposing existing ones for treatment. METHODS: We examined the relationship between TAS2R38 taster variants and AD risk using linear mixed-effects models, utilizing data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) (n = 2,342). We investigated molecular mechanisms of the association by identifying expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) using RNA-seq data from postmortem tissues from the Religious Orders Study/Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP) (n = 947). We evaluated whether FDA-approved drugs targeting the identified gene could reduce dementia risk using 1:1 propensity score-matched groups in the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC) study, comparing cognitive performance between drug-taking and non-taking patients with linear mixed-effects models (n = 76). RESULTS: TAS2R38 supertasters were linked to reduced AD risk with advancing age in various AD biomarkers (P < 0.001). eQTL analysis connected the nontaster allele to increased expression of the gene MGAM in AD-affected brain regions (P < 0.001). Elevated MGAM expression was also associated with more severe Tau burdens (P < 0.05). A significant group difference was observed in clinical dementia rating (CDR) progression (P < 0.001) in various domains for individuals taking MGAM-inhibiting diabetes drugs (Acarbose and Miglitol) compared to the non-taking group. INTERPRETATION: The genetic association between TAS2R38 and AD biomarkers implicates MGAM as a novel drug target with existing FDA-approved inhibitors. This supports the potential of TAS2R38 haplotypes in guiding precision drug repurposing strategies for AD, warranting clinical trials.

Integrative brain omics approach highlights sn-1 lysophosphatidylethanolamine in Alzheimer's dementia.	The biology of individual lipid species and their relevance in Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains incompletely understood. To explore the lipidomic biomarkers associated with cognition function and neuropathological changes in AD, we utilize non-targeted mass spectrometry on 316 post-mortem brains from participants in the Religious Orders Study (ROS) or Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP) cohorts classified as control, asymptomatic AD (AAD), or symptomatic AD (SAD), and integrate the lipidomics data with untargeted proteomics from the same individuals. We find that lysophosphatidylethanolamine (LPE) and lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) species are significantly lower in SAD than controls or AAD. Lipid-protein network analyses reveal that LPE/LPC modules are significantly associated with protein modules involved in MAPK/metabolism, post-synaptic density, and cell-ECM interaction pathways, and correlate with better antemortem cognition and reduced AD neuropathology. Particularly, LPE 22:6 [sn-1] is significantly decreased SAD and exerts a pronounced influence on protein changes relevant to neurotransmitter-driven post synaptic changes and plasticity compared to other lysophospholipids species. These findings suggest LPE 22:6 as a potential lipid signature and therapeutic target for AD.

Age-informed, attention-based weakly supervised learning for neuropathological image assessment.	Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE) and other neurodegenerative disorders (NDs) pose diagnostic challenges due to their diffuse and subtle pathological changes. Traditional diagnostic methods relying on manual histopathological slide inspection are labor-intensive and prone to variability, often missing subtle structural alterations. This study introduces an age-informed, attention-based multiple instance learning pipeline to predict AT8 density, a key marker of p-tau aggregation in CTE. Using Luxol Fast Blue and Hematoxylin & Eosin stained images, our model identifies critical pathological regions and generates interpretable attention maps highlighting structural changes linked to tau pathology. Incorporating patient age enhances predictive accuracy and contextual understanding, addressing aging's confounding effects. We also develop quantitative evaluation procedures for foundation models (FMs), assessing attention map smoothness, faithfulness, and robustness to perturbations like stain variability and noise. These benchmarks facilitate informed FM selection and optimization for neuropathological tasks. By enabling scalable, automated whole-slide image analysis, our approach advances digital neuropathology, supporting earlier and more precise ND diagnoses and uncovering subtle markers with potential applications in clinical imaging.

Predicting severity of cerebral amyloid angiopathy neuropathology: A modeling approach using NACC and ROSMAP data.	INTRODUCTION: Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is associated with an increased risk of amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA) in patients with Alzheimer's disease using anti-amyloid beta (Aβ) monoclonal antibody drugs. Here, we developed a tool, CAA risk score (CAARS) to predict the severity of CAA neuropathology. METHODS: The National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC) data were used to develop the CAARS, which was then externally validated using the Religious Orders Study and Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP) data. RESULTS: The CAARS-4 model achieved a mean area under the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC-ROC) of 0.71 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.69-0.72) and a Harrell's generalized C-index of 0.69 (95% CI: 0.68-0.71) in the NACC cohort validation. It outperformed the baseline models, and the promising performance was validated on ROSMAP participants, demonstrating the robustness and generalizability of the model. DISCUSSION: CAARS has the potential to predict CAA severity; however, its clinical utility should be evaluated in follow-up studies. HIGHLIGHTS: Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) severity can only be confirmed postmortem. CAA is associated with an elevated risk of amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA). The CAA risk score (CAARS) can stratify CAA risks in living patients. Hypertension and apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 are risk factors for CAA. The CAARS has the potential to predict risk of ARIA.

This study investigates the cytokine gene expression profile in cortical tissue samples from elderly individuals with and without AD to identify potential biomarkers and enhance our understanding of disease pathogenesis. Utilizing high-depth RNA sequencing data, we identified a set of cytokines whose expression significantly associated with different aspects of the AD phenotype, including measures of neurofibrillary tangles, amyloid-β deposition, and a person-specific rate of cognitive decline. Single-nucleus transcriptomics data facilitated the identification of specific cell types, such as microglia and astrocytes, that significantly contribute to the inflammatory response in AD. Additionally, we observed a correlation between the expression of certain cytokines and genetic risk for the disease. Our findings indicate that cytokine-mediated neuroinflammation may play an important role in neurodegeneration and that modulating the immune response may offer a promising strategy for developing new therapies.

Genetic and pathway complexity in Alzheimer's disease: Insights from multi-omic data about the immune response and mitochondrial function.	Despite recent developments, the genetics and biology of Alzheimer's disease remain insufficiently characterized. As an important first step toward developing effective treatment strategies to slow or prevent Alzheimer's disease onset, the identification of relevant genetic markers is crucial. In the present study, we analyzed transcriptomic and multi-omic datasets across multiple cohorts (the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, Religious Orders Study and Rush Memory and Aging Project, Mount Sinai Brain Bank, and Mayo Clinic Alzheimer's Disease Genetics Studies) using gene set enrichment analysis, machine learning algorithms, and polygenic risk scoring to identify gene sets relevant to Alzheimer's disease risk and pathological features. For prioritized gene sets, we performed epigenome-wide association studies to assess DNA methylation patterns, and used multi-omic mediation analysis to characterize the causal gene regulatory networks. Overall, we identified several key gene sets relevant to Alzheimer's disease pathology-particularly, those related to immune system function and mitochondrial dysfunction. Upregulated pathways, including neutrophil degranulation and tumor necrosis factor-α signaling pathways, correlated strongly with aspects of neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's disease. By contrast, downregulated oxidative phosphorylation pathways further suggested mitochondrial dysfunction. Gene sets that contained mitochondrially located genes (e.g., SGK1 and LRRK1) were identified as significantly contributing to neurodegeneration. Moreover, genes such as CXCL1, TGFB2, and DUSP1 were consistently implicated in all datasets, thus emphasizing their involvement in immune modulation and mitochondrial function. The multimodal investigation outlined in the current study represents useful steps toward comprehending the genetic architecture of Alzheimer's disease, including an expanded understanding of the spatial interactions of genes associated with disease susceptibility. Mitochondrial dysfunction and immune modulation were pathological pathways that converged on Alzheimer's disease and future treatment novel options. Using the frameworks provided in the current comprehensive study, we present opportunities to explore targeted treatment strategies that may alter immune systems and mitochondrial function to optimize treatment outcomes for individuals at increased risk of or living with Alzheimer's disease.

Increased availability of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) has facilitated the study of rare variants (RVs) in complex diseases. Multiple RV association tests are available to study the relationship between genotype and phenotype, but most do not fully leverage the availability of variant-level functional annotations. We propose genome-wide rare variant enrichment evaluation (gruyere), an empirical Bayesian framework that complements existing methods by learning global, trait-specific weights for functional annotations to improve variant prioritization. We apply gruyere to WGS data from the Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project to identify Alzheimer disease (AD)-associated genes and annotations. Growing evidence suggests that the disruption of microglial regulation is a key contributor to AD risk, yet existing methods have not examined rare non-coding effects that incorporate such cell-type-specific information. To address this gap, we (1) define per-gene non-coding RV test sets using predicted enhancer and promoter regions in microglia and other brain cell types (oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, and neurons) and (2) include cell-type-specific variant effect predictions (VEPs) as functional annotations. gruyere identifies 13 significant genetic associations not detected by other RV methods, four of which remain significant in omnibus tests. We find that deep-learning-based VEPs for splicing, transcription factor binding, and chromatin state are highly predictive of functional non-coding RVs. Our study establishes a robust framework incorporating functional annotations, coding RVs, and cell-type-associated non-coding RVs to perform genome-wide association tests, uncovering AD-relevant genes and annotations.

Altered mitochondrial DNA methylation in blood in individuals with mild cognitive impairment.	BACKGROUND: Previous studies reported that altered mitochondrial methylation in Alzheimer's disease (AD), however, whether epigenetic modifications in mitochondrial genomes contribute to preclinical AD remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate mitochondrial methylation changes in individuals with cognitive decline. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We examined whole mitochondrial genome methylation in 50 individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 50 individuals without MCI, using bisulfite amplicon sequencing, assessing methylation at 366 Cytosine-guanine oligodeoxynucleotide (CpG) sites. RESULTS: We found the overall methylation level of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in each subject was relatively low, ranging from 0% to 15%. Global methylation was significantly higher in individuals with cognitive decline compared to controls (3.86% vs. 3.46%, CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides an mtDNA methylation map and suggests a role for these sites in preclinical AD pathogenesis. Alzheimer’s disease is a brain condition that causes memory loss and thinking problems. Before the disease becomes serious, people may show early signs like forgetting things or having trouble focusing. This stage is called “mild cognitive impairment” or MCI. Finding it early can help doctors provide better care. In this study, we looked at small chemical changes in cell parts called mitochondria. These changes, called DNA methylation, can affect how genes work. We took blood samples from 50 older adults with memory problems and compared them to 50 healthy people of the same age and gender. We used a special test to check over 300 spots in the mitochondrial DNA. We found that some of these spots were more changed in people with memory problems. These changes were linked to lower memory test scores and could help tell who has early memory decline. This research shows that changes in mitochondrial DNA might be early warning signs of Alzheimer’s disease. In the future, a simple blood test may help find the disease before it gets worse.

Decoding the Effects of Bexarotene treatment on brain of AD-like model mice: Single-Cell Transcriptomics and Chromatin Accessibility Analysis.	BACKGOUND: Ligand-activated Retinoid X Receptors (RXRs) regulate gene networks essential for neural development, neuroinflammation, and metabolism. Understanding how RXR activation influences chromatin architecture and gene expression may reveal therapeutic strategies for neurodegenerative diseases. METHODS: We used Bexarotene-treated APP/PS1ΔE9 mice to study RXR-mediated regulatory mechanisms. To investigate epigenomic and transcriptional effects, we integrated single-nucleus ATAC-seq (snATAC-seq) with single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) and validated differentially accessible chromatin peaks using RXR ChIP-seq. Transcription factor (TF) footprinting analysis were performed to map regulatory networks activated by ligand-bound RXR. RESULTS: Our integrated analyses revealed a multilayered transcriptional cascade initiated by a single linear RXR signaling event. We identified RXR-centered regulatory circuits involving heterodimer activation, subsequent upregulation of multiple downstream TFs, and induction of metabolic pathways relevant to neural function. The results of a detailed analysis of TF regulatory networks in neuronal systems suggests that Bexarotene doesn't dismantle the fundamental regulatory scaffold in neurons but rather modulates RXR regulatory role through existing TF networks. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that combining scRNA-seq, snATAC-seq, and ChIP-seq enables a comprehensive analysis of RXR-mediated transcriptional regulation. RXR activation orchestrates complex gene networks that may help restore brain homeostasis in the context of amyloid pathology, neuroinflammation, and neuronal injury.

Epigenomic subtypes of late-onset Alzheimer's disease reveal distinct microglial signatures.	Growing evidence suggests that clinical, pathological, and genetic heterogeneity in late onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) contributes to variable therapeutic outcomes, potentially explaining many trial failures. Advances in molecular subtyping through proteomic and transcriptomic profiling reveal distinct patient subgroups, highlighting disease complexity beyond amyloid-beta plaques and tau tangles. This underscores the need to expand subtyping across new molecular layers, to identify novel drug targets for different patient subgroups. In this study, we analyzed genome-wide DNA methylation (DNAm) data from three independent postmortem brain cohorts (N = 831) to identify epigenetic subtypes of LOAD. Unsupervised clustering approaches were employed to identify distinct DNAm patterns, with subsequent cross-cohort validation. We assessed how subtype-specific methylation signatures map onto individual brain cell types by comparing them with DNAm profiles from purified cells. Next, we integrated bulk and single-cell RNA-seq data to determine each subtype's functional impact on gene expression. Finally, we explored clinical and neuropathological correlates of the identified subtypes to elucidate biological and clinical significance. We identified two distinct epigenomic subtypes of LOAD, consistently observed across three cohorts. Both subtypes exhibit significant yet distinct microglial methylation enrichment. Bulk transcriptomic analyses further highlighted distinct biological mechanisms underlying these subtypes: subtype 1 was enriched for immune-related processes, while subtype 2 was characterized by neuronal and synaptic pathways. Single-cell transcriptional profiling of microglia revealed subtype-specific inflammatory states: subtype 1 displayed chronic innate immune hyperactivation with impaired resolution, whereas subtype 2 exhibited a more dynamic inflammatory profile, balancing pro-inflammatory signaling with reparative and regulatory mechanisms. These findings reveal distinct epigenetic and functional microglial states underlying LOAD subtypes, advancing our understanding of disease heterogeneity. This work lays the groundwork for targeted therapeutic strategies tailored to specific molecular and cellular disease profiles.	Alzheimer’s disease; DNA methylation; Epigenetics; Microglia; Subtyping

Estimating progression of Alzheimer's disease with extracellular vesicle-related multi-omics risk models.	BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is heterogeneous and shows complex interconnected pathways at various biological levels. Risk scores contribute greatly to disease prognosis and biomarker discovery but typically represent generic risk factors. However, large-scale multi-omics data can generate individualized risk factors. Filtering these risk factors with brain-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) could yield key pathologic pathways and vesicular vehicles for treatment delivery. METHODS: A list of 460 EV-related genes was curated from brain tissue samples in the ExoCarta database. This list was used to select genes from transcriptomics, proteomics, and DNA methylation data. Significant risk factors included demographic features (age, sex) and genes significant for progression in transcriptomics data. These genes were selected using Cox regression, aided by the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), and were used to construct three risk models at different omics levels. Gene signatures from the significant risk factors were used as biomarkers for further evaluation, including gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) and drug perturbation analysis. RESULTS: Nine EV-related genes were identified as significant risk factors. All three risk models predicted high/low risk groups with significant separation in Kaplan-Meier analysis. Training the transcriptomics risk models on EV-related genes yielded better AD classification results than using all genes in an independent dataset. GSEA revealed Mitophagy and several other significant pathways related to AD. Four drugs showed therapeutic potential to target the identified risk factors based on Connectivity Map analysis. CONCLUSION: The proposed risk score model demonstrates a novel approach to AD using EV-related large-scale multi-omics data. Potential biomarkers and pathways related to AD were identified for further investigation. Drug candidates were identified for further evaluation in biological experiments, potentially transported to targeted tissues via bioengineered EVs.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by Aβ accumulation and tau hyperphosphorylation. Calcium dysregulation also plays a key role in its progression. As a vital second messenger, calcium ions regulate neuronal communication, memory formation, and learning, particularly in the hippocampus. Their levels are influenced by excitatory signaling, synapse formation, and neurotransmitter release.

Uncovering plaque-glia niches in human Alzheimer's disease brains using spatial transcriptomics.	BACKGROUND: Amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques and their associated glial responses are hallmark features of Alzheimer's disease (AD), yet their interactions within the human brain remain poorly defined. METHODS: We applied spatial transcriptomics (ST) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) to 78 postmortem brain sections from 21 individuals in the Religious Orders Study and Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP). We paired ST with histological data and stratified spots into major categories of plaque-glia niches based on Aβ, GFAP, and IBA1 intensity. Leveraging published ROSMAP single-nucleus RNA-seq data, we examined differences in gene expression, cellular composition, and intercellular communication across these niches. Neuronal and glial changes were validated by IHC and quantitative analyses. We further characterized glial responses using gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) with known mouse glial signatures and human AD-associated microglial states. Finally, we used iPSC-derived multicellular cultures and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to identify cell types that, upon short-term Aβ exposure, recapitulate the glial responses observed in the human spatial data. RESULTS: Low-Aβ regions, enriched for diffuse plaques, exhibited transcriptomic profiles consistent with greater neuronal loss than high-Aβ regions. High-glia regions showed increased expression of inflammatory and neurodegenerative pathways. Spatial glial responses aligned with established gene modules, including plaque-induced genes (PIGs), oligodendrocyte (OLIG) responses, disease-associated microglia (DAM), disease-associated astrocytes (DAA), and human AD-associated microglial states, indicating that diverse glial phenotypes emerge around plaques and shape the local immune environment. IHC confirmed elevated neuronal apoptosis near low-Aβ plaques and greater CD68 abundance and synaptic loss near glia-high plaques. In vitro, iPSC-derived microglia-but not astrocytes-exposed to Aβ displayed transcriptomic changes that closely mirrored the glial states identified in our ST dataset. CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides a comprehensive spatial transcriptomic dataset from human AD brain tissue and bridges spatial gene expression with traditional neuropathology. By integrating ST, snRNA-seq, and human multicellular models, we map cellular states and molecular events within plaque-glia niches. This work offers a spatially resolved framework for dissecting plaque-glia interactions and reveals new insights into the cellular and molecular heterogeneity underlying neurodegenerative pathology.

Traditional statistical approaches have advanced our understanding of the genetics of complex diseases, yet are limited to linear additive models. Here we applied machine learning (ML) to genome-wide data from 41,686 individuals in the largest European consortium on Alzheimer's disease (AD) to investigate the effectiveness of various ML algorithms in replicating known findings, discovering novel loci, and predicting individuals at risk. We utilised Gradient Boosting Machines (GBMs), biological pathway-informed Neural Networks (NNs), and Model-based Multifactor Dimensionality Reduction (MB-MDR) models. ML approaches successfully captured all genome-wide significant genetic variants identified in the training set and 22% of associations from larger meta-analyses. They highlight 6 novel loci which replicate in an external dataset, including variants which map to ARHGAP25, LY6H, COG7, SOD1 and ZNF597. They further identify novel association in AP4E1, refining the genetic landscape of the known SPPL2A locus. Our results demonstrate that machine learning methods can achieve predictive performance comparable to classical approaches in genetic epidemiology and have the potential to uncover novel loci that remain undetected by traditional GWAS. These insights provide a complementary avenue for advancing the understanding of AD genetics.

Spatially resolved transcriptomics reveals a unique disease signature and potential biomarkers for chronic traumatic encephalopathy.	"Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a poorly understood environmental tauopathy uniquely associated with repetitive head injury. It is clinically ambiguous and at present can only be diagnosed post-mortem. There is a pressing need to understand CTE pathophysiology in order to identify targets for possible intervention and biomarkers for in-life diagnosis. However, molecular characterization of the disease is hampered by the stochastic distribution of CTE lesions. Here, we have taken advantage of Visium spatial transcriptomics to map gene expression in discrete CTE lesions and matched normal tissue from the same individuals. In doing so, we derived a common 21-gene ""signature"" of CTE lesions that highlights astrocytic activation, neuroinflammation, blood-brain barrier function, and extracellular matrix remodeling as key features of CTE lesions. Almost all CTE signature genes were strongly expressed in astrocytes and ontological and protein association analyses implicated extracellular matrix functions as drivers of the disease. These findings provide the first glimpse into the intricate molecular dynamics underlying CTE lesions in situ and present 21 candidate molecules for the development of in-life CTE diagnostics."

Multi-ancestry genome-wide meta-analysis of 56,241 individuals identifies known and novel cross-population and ancestry-specific associations as novel risk loci for Alzheimer's disease.	BACKGROUND: Limited ancestral diversity has impaired our ability to detect risk variants more prevalent in ancestry groups of predominantly non-European ancestral background in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). We construct and analyze a multi-ancestry GWAS dataset in the Alzheimer's Disease Genetics Consortium (ADGC) to test for novel shared and population-specific late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) susceptibility loci and evaluate underlying genetic architecture in 37,382 non-Hispanic White (NHW), 6728 African American, 8899 Hispanic (HIS), and 3232 East Asian individuals, performing within ancestry fixed-effects meta-analysis followed by a cross-ancestry random-effects meta-analysis. RESULTS: We identify 13 loci with cross-population associations including known loci at/near CR1, BIN1, TREM2, CD2AP, PTK2B, CLU, SHARPIN, MS4A6A, PICALM, ABCA7, APOE, and two novel loci not previously reported at 11p12 (LRRC4C) and 12q24.13 (LHX5-AS1). We additionally identify three population-specific loci with genome-wide significance at/near PTPRK and GRB14 in HIS and KIAA0825 in NHW. Pathway analysis implicates multiple amyloid regulation pathways and the classical complement pathway. Genes at/near our novel loci have known roles in neuronal development (LRRC4C, LHX5-AS1, and PTPRK) and insulin receptor activity regulation (GRB14). CONCLUSIONS: Using cross-population GWAS meta-analyses, we identify novel LOAD susceptibility loci in/near LRRC4C and LHX5-AS1, both with known roles in neuronal development, as well as several novel population-unique loci. Reflecting the power of diverse ancestry in GWAS, we detect the SHARPIN locus with only 13.7% of the sample size of the NHW GWAS study (n = 409,589) in which this locus was first observed. Continued expansion into larger multi-ancestry studies will provide even more power for further elucidating the genomics of late-onset Alzheimer's disease.

The utilization of artificial intelligence in studying the dysregulation of gene expression in Alzheimer's disease (AD) affected brain tissues remains underexplored, particularly in delineating common and specific transcriptomic signatures across different brain regions implicated in AD-related cellular and molecular processes, which could help illuminate novel disease biology for biomarker and target discovery. Herein we developed a deep learning framework, which consisted of multi-layer perceptron (MLP) models to classify neuropathologically confirmed AD versus controls, using bulk tissue RNA-seq data from the RNAseq Harmonization Study of the Accelerating Medicines Project for Alzheimer's Disease (AMP-AD) consortium. The models were trained based on data from three distinct brain regions, including dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), and head of the caudate nucleus (HCN), obtained from the Religious Orders Study/Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP). Subsequently, we inferred a disease progression trajectory for each brain region by applying unsupervised dimensionality transformation to the distribution of the subjects' expression profiles. To interpret the MLP models, we employed an interpretable method for deep neural network models, obtaining SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values and identified the most significantly AD-implicated genes for gene co-expression network analysis. Our models demonstrated robust performance in classification and prediction across two other external datasets from the Mayo RNA-seq (MAYO) cohort and the Mount Sinai Brain Bank (MSBB) cohort of AMP-AD. By interpreting the models both mechanistically and biologically, our study elucidated subtle molecular alterations in various brain regions, uncovering shared transcriptomic signatures activated in microglia and sex-specific modules in neurons relevant to AD. Notably, we identified, for the first time, a sex-linked transcription factor pair (ZFX/ZFY) associated with more pronounced neuronal loss in AD females, shedding light on a novel mechanism for sex dimorphism in AD. This study lays the groundwork for leveraging artificial intelligence methodologies to investigate AD at the molecular level, which is not readily achievable from conventional analysis approaches such as differential gene expression (DGE) analysis. The transcription factor implicated in sex difference also underpins a new molecular mechanistic basis of women's greater neurodegeneration in AD warranting further study.

Sex Differences in Associations of Lewy Body Disease with Alzheimer's Disease and Cognitive Decline.	OBJECTIVE: To investigate how sex and age at menopause influence the interplay between Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Lewy body disease (LBD) neuropathologies, and their associations with cognitive decline. METHODS: We analyzed data from: (1) three Rush Alzheimer's Disease Center cohorts (i.e., the Religious Orders Study, Rush Memory and Aging Project, and Minority Aging Research Study), and (2) the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center Neuropathology Data Set. Neuropathological evaluation assessed LBD (neocortical/limbic-type vs none) and AD, including neuritic plaques (β-amyloid plaques surrounded by dystrophic neurites) and neurofibrillary tangles. In each dataset, we tested interactive associations between LBD and sex on neuritic plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and cognitive decline. Additionally, in the Rush dataset, we tested whether age at spontaneous menopause modified the associations of LBD with neuritic plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and cognitive decline in women. RESULTS: In the Rush dataset, we included 1,277 women and 579 men. In the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center dataset, we included 3,283 women and 3,563 men. Across both datasets, men were more likely to have LBD, whereas women showed greater neuritic plaque and neurofibrillary tangle burdens. Sex modified the associations of LBD with neurofibrillary tangles (but not neuritic plaques), whereby LBD was more strongly associated with greater neurofibrillary tangle burden in women than men. Men showed faster LBD-related cognitive decline, whereas women showed faster neurofibrillary tangle-related decline, after adjusting for copathologies (neuritic plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and LBD, as appropriate). In women, earlier age at menopause exacerbated the associations of LBD with neurofibrillary tangle burden and episodic memory decline. INTERPRETATION: Sex may influence AD and LBD neuropathologies, highlighting the need for precision approaches to dementia prevention and intervention. ANN NEUROL 2025;98:1014-1026.

Comprehensive characterization of the RNA editing landscape in the human aging brains with Alzheimer's disease.	INTRODUCTION: While RNA editing has been linked to Alzheimer's disease (AD), its specific impact on the transcriptomic landscape in human AD brains remains under explored. METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive analysis of RNA editing across nine human brain regions affected by AD, utilizing RNA-seq data and matched whole-genome sequencing data from three human brain biobanks, adjusting for age, post mortem interval, sex, and apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4) status. RESULTS: RNA-editing events were identified in both AD and healthy control aging brains, highlighting 127 genes with significant RNA editing loci. AD exhibited elevated RNA editing in the parahippocampal gyrus and cerebellar cortex. We also discovered 147 colocalized genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and cis-edQTL (± 1 MB) signals in 48 likely causal genes encompassing CLU, BIN1, and GRIN3B, primarily allied to amyloid and tau pathology, and neuroinflammation. DISCUSSION: Our findings delineate RNA editing regulatory signatures in human AD, providing novel insights into AD pathophysiology and potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets. HIGHLIGHTS: ·We discovered genome-wide landscape of RNA editing signals from 4208 (1364 Alzheimer's disease [AD] cases vs. 742 healthy controls) RNA-seq data across nine human brain regions from three large brain biobanks (Mount Sinai Brain Bank [MSBB], Mayo Clinic [MAYO] Religious Order Study and Memory and Aging Project [ROSMAP]) tied with AD, including in sex-specific and apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4) -specific manner adjusting for age, post mortem interval (PMI), sex, and APOE4 status. ·We emphasize 127 genes, including SYT11, KCNIP4, NRG3, ANKS1B, and RALYL, exhibiting significant RNA editing loci shared by multiple brain tissues, mainly implicated in synaptic plasticity, signaling and transmission, neuronal development, and morphogenesis. ·Brain-wide tissue-specific cis-regulatory variants (cis-edQTLs) were inspected using matched genotyping data from 3627 samples from all brain biobanks. We revealed 147 colocalized AD-GWAS and cis-edQTLs signals pertaining to 48 likely causal genes comprising CLU (rs7982, rs1532278), BIN1 (rs2276582, rs3768863), GRIN3B (rs10417824, rs1058603), NYAP1 (rs12539172), DGKQ (rs4690197, rs3733347), CLPTM1 (rs204468), etc. ·Colocalized signals show affiliations to tau protein binding, amyloid-β regulation, cellular morphogenesis, and immune response pathway suggesting possible roles of epitranscriptomic mechanisms in shaping the AD risk.

ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Saikosaponin C (SSc), a traditional Chinese herbal medicine, is a triterpene saponin and an active compound extracted from Radix Bupleuri. It has been demonstrated to have neuroprotective effects in cellular models of neurodegenerative diseases; however, its precise mechanism of action in alleviating tau pathology in Alzheimer's disease (AD), as well as its potential to improve cognitive deficits in animal models, has not yet been elucidated. AIM OF THE STUDY: In this study, we investigated the in vivo therapeutic effects of SSc on a human tau (hTau) mouse model expressing normal hTau isoforms in terms of tau-related pathology (tauopathy) and the underlying mechanisms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: For the animal study, C57BL/6 mice received stereotaxic brain injections of adeno-associated virus (AAV)-hTau in the absence or presence of SSc. The Morris water maze test was employed to evaluate the therapeutic effects of SSc on memory and learning. Tau phosphorylation in the brain was assessed by immunofluorescence and Western blotting. Dendritic spine maturation, an indicator of synaptic plasticity, was determined by assessing doublecortin expression and performing automatic dendritic spine analysis. GFAP and Iba1 immunoreactivity were observed as indicators of neuroinflammation. Dityrosine formation and superoxide dismutase 2 expression were measured to monitor oxidative stress. For the mechanistic study, RNA-Seq was used to identify tauopathy-related changes in gene expression. Furthermore, the effects of SSc on aluminum chloride (AlCl RESULTS: We found that SSc significantly relieved spatial memory impairment and alleviated the pathological hallmarks of AD-like tau, such as excessive tau phosphorylation and oxidative stress, in AAV-hTau-injected mice. SSc also relieved the deficit in dendritic spine density in mice with tauopathy-associated dementia. Neuroinflammation, another hallmark of AD-like pathology, was reduced by SSc treatment. Furthermore, SSc attenuated AlCl CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that SSc treatment ameliorates cognitive deficits and related tau pathological features in the hTau AD mouse model. The antioxidant effects of SSc might be responsible for the therapeutic potential of SSc in protecting against tau pathology and cognitive decline.

Multidimensional MRI reveals cortical astrogliosis linked to dementia in Alzheimer's disease.	Despite the presence of significant Alzheimer's disease pathology, characterized by amyloid β (Aβ) plaques and phosphorylated tau (pTau) tangles, some cognitively unimpaired elderly individuals do not inevitably develop dementia. Cortical astroglial inflammation, a ubiquitous feature of symptomatic Alzheimer's disease, shows a strong correlation with cognitive impairment severity, highlighting the influence of factors beyond classical pathology. However, non-invasively imaging neuroinflammation, particularly astrogliosis, using MRI remains a significant challenge. Here we sought to address this challenge and to leverage multidimensional (MD) MRI, a powerful approach that combines relaxation with diffusion MR contrasts, to map cortical astrogliosis in the human brain by accessing sub-voxel information. Our goal was to investigate whether MD-MRI can map astroglial pathology in the cerebral cortex, and if so, whether it can distinguish cognitively normal state from dementia in the presence of hallmark Alzheimer's disease neuropathological changes. We adopted a multimodal approach by integrating histological and MRI analyses using human postmortem brain samples from two independent discovery and replication cohorts.

Aging is the strongest risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD), yet the molecular mechanisms linking aging to AD remain poorly understood. DNA methylation (DNAm) is an epigenetic modification that plays a critical role in gene regulation and has been implicated in both aging and AD. In this study, we performed a meta-analysis of DNAm profiles in the prefrontal cortex using two large, independent postmortem brain cohorts, the Religious Orders Study and Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP) and Brains for Dementia Research (BDR), to identify DNAm differences associated with aging in late life. We identified 3,264 CpGs significantly associated with aging, the majority of which were hypermethylated and enriched in promoter regions and CpG islands. These aging-associated DNAm changes were significantly overrepresented in genes involved in immune regulation and metabolic pathways. When compared with AD-associated DNAm changes, we found a significant overlap, with nearly all CpGs and differentially methylated regions (DMRs) that were associated with both aging and AD Braak stage displaying concordant directionality. This supports the hypothesis that aging and AD are interconnected at the molecular level. Further integrative analyses indicated that a number of these DNAm variants may have functional relevance in AD. By integrating blood DNAm data, we identified multiple CpGs that showed significant brain-to-blood correlations and were involved in both aging and AD pathogenesis. Co-localization analyses with genome-wide association study (GWAS) data revealed shared genetic regulation of DNAm and dementia at several AD risk loci. Out-of-sample validation using the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset demonstrated that, among 334 CpGs showing concordant DNAm changes in aging and AD, baseline DNAm levels at cg10752406 in the	Aging; Alzheimer’s disease; DNA methylation; biomarkers; epigenetics

Investigating the Blood Microbiome in Parkinson's Disease, Schizophrenia, and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder.	INTRODUCTION: Recent studies have challenged the idea of sterile blood, suggesting the presence of a blood microbiome. The detection of microbial nucleic acids in blood is thought to reflect the status of distant microbial niches, including the gut. However, the origins and viability of these microbes remain debated. In this study, blood microbiome signatures in Parkinson's disease (PD), schizophrenia (SCZ), and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) were evaluated by extracting RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) reads that did not map to the human genome. Furthermore, we investigated the correlation between the gut and blood microbiome in PD, SCZ, and PTSD to gain insight into possible mechanisms behind disease etiology. METHODS: We used whole-blood samples from PD (cases: n = 14; controls: n = 19), SCZ (cases: n = 17; controls: n = 22), and PTSD (cases: n = 45; trauma-exposed [TE] controls: n = 34) cohorts. The RNA paired-end sequence reads that did not map to the human reference genome (hg38/GRCH38) were isolated using the sequence alignment/map tools (SAMtools). These unmapped reads were classified against known archaeal, bacterial, and viral microbial genomes using Kraken2 (v2.1.3; k2_standard_08gb_20240112.taz.gz database), and further taxa abundances were estimated using Bracken (v2.9). The differential abundance of blood microbial signatures between case-control groups for each cohort was assessed using DESeq2 (v1.38.3). Each cohort was analyzed separately. RESULTS: Statistically significant differences in the abundance of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter wuhouensis in PD and Salmonella enterica, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas sp. CC6-YY-74, and Shinella sumterensis in SCZ were observed compared to cohort-specific controls. We observed no statistically significant differences in microbial signatures between PTSD cases and controls. CONCLUSION: We found blood microbial signatures associated with PD and SCZ; however, no significant blood microbial signature was observed for PTSD. These results should be interpreted with caution as biases may have been introduced due to low concentrations of microbial signatures. Further research is required to understand the biological implications of these findings, in particular, taking into account the repurposed data source, and the potential for contamination (during phlebotomy, and background contamination from DNA extraction and reagents) known to impact the analysis of low-biomass samples.

Age-informed, attention-based weakly supervised learning for neuropathological image assessment.	Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE) and other neurodegenerative disorders (NDs) pose diagnostic challenges due to their diffuse and subtle pathological changes. Traditional diagnostic methods relying on manual histopathological slide inspection are labor-intensive and prone to variability, often missing subtle structural alterations. This study introduces an age-informed, attention-based multiple instance learning (MIL) pipeline to predict AT8 density, a key marker of p-tau aggregation in CTE. Using Luxol Fast Blue and Hematoxylin & Eosin (LH&E) stained images, our model identifies critical pathological regions and generates interpretable attention maps highlighting structural changes linked to tau pathology. Incorporating patient age enhances predictive accuracy and contextual understanding, addressing aging's confounding effects. We also develop quantitative evaluation procedures for foundation models (FMs), assessing attention map smoothness, faithfulness, and robustness to perturbations like stain variability and noise. These benchmarks facilitate informed FM selection and optimization for neuropathological tasks. By enabling scalable, automated whole-slide image (WSI) analysis, our approach advances digital neuropathology, supporting earlier and more precise ND diagnoses and uncovering subtle markers with potential applications in clinical imaging.

Brain Multi-Omic Subtypes of Neuroticism reveal molecular signatures linked to Alzheimer's Disease.	IMPORTANCE: Molecular mechanisms linking neuroticism with Alzheimer's disease traits are unknown. OBJECTIVE: To identify molecular subtypes of neuroticism and examine their association with ADRD traits. DESIGN: Three ongoing cohort studies were used; Religious Orders Study (ROS), Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP) and Minority Aging Research Study (MARS), that began enrollment in 1994, 1997, and 2004, respectively. SETTING: Older priests, nuns, and brothers from across the U.S. (ROS), older adults (MAP) and older African-American adults (MARS) from across the greater Chicago metropolitan area. PARTICIPANTS: 1,028 decedents with multi-omic data from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), the anterior cingulate cortex (AC), and the posterior cingulate gyrus (PCG). EXPOSURES: Eight layers of omics (DNA methylation and histone acetylation from DLPFC; RNA seq from AC, DLPFC, and PCG, single-nucleus RNA, TMT proteomics and metabolomics from DLPFC) and Neuroticism using the 12-item version from the NEO Five-Factor Inventory. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Person-specific multi-omic molecular pseudotime representing molecular progression from low to high phenotypic expression of neuroticism, and three multi-omic brain molecular subtypes of neuroticism which represent distinct omic pathways from no/low neuroticism to high neuroticism that differ by their omic constituents. Participants are exclusively assigned to the subtype which aligns mostly with their multi-omic profile. RESULTS: The top drivers of subtype differentiation were transcriptomic alterations across three brain regions (DLPFC, AC, PCG) which extensively and differentially characterized the subtypes. The subtypes were also differentially associated with AD pathology, temporal lobe atrophy, and AD dementia, with subtype N CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Neuroticism may be driven by three distinct molecular subtypes, with subtype N	ADRD; brain multi-omics; molecular pseudotime; molecular subtypes; neuroticism

Linking DNA methylation in brain regions to Alzheimer's disease risk: a Mendelian randomization study.	AIM: DNA methylation in brain regions represents a potential mechanism linking genetic variation to Alzheimer's disease (ad) risk, yet most studies have focused on blood-derived methylation markers. In this study, we conducted a systematic Mendelian randomization (MR) study to evaluate associations between predicted brain region-specific DNA methylation levels and ad risk, using methylation quantitative trait loci (mQTL) as genetic instruments. METHODS: We analyzed mQTLs from five human brain regions: cerebellum (CRBLM), frontal cortex (FCTX), causal pons (PONS), and temporal cortex (TCTX) from 600 individuals in Gibbs et al's study, as well as mQTLs from dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) of 543 participants in the Religious Orders Study and the Rush Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP). In our MR analyses, we integrated these mQTLs with single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP)-ad risk summary statistics derived from 85 934 ad-related cases and 401 577 normal controls. RESULTS: Among 62 554 cytosine-guanine dinucleotide (CpG) sites, we identified 597 CpG sites (CpGs) significantly associated with ad risk (false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05). Of these, 289 were confirmed through colocalization and summary-based MR (SMR) analyses, including one CpG site in CRBLM, 285 in DLPFC, one in FCTX, two in PONS, and one in TCTX. By integrating gene expression data, we identified 19 CpG sites with consistent associations across methylation levels, expression of eight target genes, and ad risk, including novel regulatory mechanisms involving RITA1's modulation of cg11558705 and PCGF3's regulation of cg10009224. CONCLUSION: Our findings highlight brain region-specific DNA methylation as a mediator of genetic risk for ad, offering insights into ad pathogenesis and identifying potential therapeutic targets.

Cardiovascular-Derived Circulating Cell-Free DNA Fragments Are Associated With Frailty and Increased Cardiovascular Events in Older Adults.	Increased cellular damage in aging tissues releases circulating cell-free genomic DNA (ccf-gDNA) into the bloodstream, and these fragments are associated with a higher risk of frailty and dementia. We hypothesized that identifying the tissue of origin for ccf-gDNA using methylation signatures can distinguish subgroups of participants with distinct clinical outcomes, biological aging rates, and energy use. Serum ccf-gDNA from 181 participants in the Religious Orders Study or Rush Memory and Aging Project (ROS-MAP) was assessed for DNA methylation at one timepoint using the Illumina MethylationEPIC array. Clinical outcomes 6 years after ccf-gDNA measurement were determined for the following: frailty, cognitive test scores, and cardiovascular disease. Hierarchical clustering identified major clusters based on the predominance of ccf-gDNA source: cardiovascular, erythrocyte progenitor, and immune cell. Participants with cardiovascular-enriched ccf-gDNA (CV ccf-gDNA) had higher rates of myocardial infarction (39%) at the last study visit compared to other subgroups (Immune ccf-gDNA: 21%; Erythrocyte ccf-gDNA: 23%), and similar findings were observed for congestive heart disease and stroke. There were no significant associations between cognitive test scores and ccf-gDNA subgroups. Individuals with CV ccf-gDNA demonstrated 3.1 times higher odds of being frail compared to the other groups and showed increased epigenetic age acceleration for the fragments compared to the other subgroups, indicating that this group was enriched with ccf-gDNA originating from older cells. The CV ccf-gDNA subgroup exhibited dysregulation of glycine and serine metabolism and pathways integral to cardiovascular health, endothelial function, and inflammation. We demonstrate that ccf-gDNA methylation patterns can detect high-turnover tissues and identify older adults at higher risk of frailty and cardiovascular disease.

Identification and characterization of the thalamic ventral posterior complex by 11.7T ex vivo diffusion tensor imaging.	The thalamic ventral posterior (VP) nuclear complex includes several subnuclei, including the VPM, VPL, VPI, and VMb, each with distinct inputs, axonal trajectories, and staining properties. Understanding the three-dimensional organization of neuronal fiber structures of the VP complex is crucial for understanding intra-thalamic and thalamocortical connections related to somatosensory processing. In this study, an ex vivo block of the human brain was scanned using mesoscopic Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI), and the four VP subnuclei were identified using existing histological atlases as references. The VP subnuclei were characterized using a mean diffusivity (MeanD) map, orientation-coded fractional anisotropy (FA) map, and tractography obtained from DTI. The results demonstrated differential patterns in MeanD and orientation-coded FA maps among the four subnuclei, underscoring the potential of mesoscale imaging to identify and differentiate these subnuclei. The tractography identified patterns of afferent and efferent fibers unique to each nucleus, offering insights into their functional roles in sensory processing. The findings highlighted the advantages of DTI in visualizing the direction of fibrous structures and conducting three-dimensional tractography, offering a foundation for further investigations into in vivo imaging applications and the neural mechanisms of somatosensory disorders, including central pain syndrome.

BACKGROUND: Previous studies have shown significant sex differences in AD with regarding its epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical presentation, and treatment response. However, the transcriptome variances associated with sex in AD remain unclear. METHODS: RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and transcriptomic analyses were performed on peripheral blood samples from total of 54 patients, including male AD patients (n = 15), female AD patients (n = 10), male MCI patients (n = 7), female MCI patients (n = 11), male healthy controls (n = 6), female healthy controls (n = 5). The snRNA-seq dataset (GSE167494, GSE157827) of prefrontal cortex tissues was obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). We conducted an investigation into differentially expressed genes and pathways in the peripheral blood cells as well as prefrontal cortex tissues of both male and female AD patients with consideration to sex-related factors. Additionally, we analyzed the distribution and characteristics of cells in the cerebral cortex as well as the interaction and communication between cells of male and female AD patients. Connectivity Map (CMap) was utilized for predicting and screening potential sex-specific drugs for AD. RESULTS: The transcriptome profile and associated biological processes in the peripheral blood of male and female AD and MCI patients exhibit discernible differences, including upregulation of BASP1 in AD male patients and arousing TNS1 in AD female patients. The distribution of various cell types in the prefrontal cortex tissues differs between male and female AD patients, like neuron and oligodendrocyte decreased and endothelial cell and astrocyte increased in female compared with male, while a multitude of genes exhibit significant differential expression. The results of cell communication analysis, such as collagen signaling pathway, suggest that sex disparities impact intercellular interactions within prefrontal cortex tissues among individuals with AD. By drug repositioning, several drugs, including torin-2 and YM-298198, might have the potential to therapeutic value of MCI or AD, while drugs like homoharringtonine and teniposide have potential opposite effects in different sexes. CONCLUSION: The characteristics of the transcriptome in peripheral blood and single-cell transcriptome in the prefrontal cortex exhibit significant differences between male and female patients with AD, which providing a basis for future sex stratified treatment of AD.

Identification of a circRNA-miRNA-mRNA interactome associated with Parkinson's disease progression.	BackgroundCircular RNAs (circRNAs) constitute a distinctive subclass of RNAs that are known for their regulatory roles in fundamental cellular processes. Due to their increased stability and ubiquitous expression, circular RNAs have been widely studied as potential molecular targets in various diseases, including neurodegenerative diseases. While several studies have found differentially expressed circRNAs associated with Parkinson's disease (PD), none has looked specifically into PD progression.ObjectiveTo elucidate the role of circRNAs in the progression of PD by identifying dysregulated circRNAs associated with PD progression and to pinpoint potential downstream miRNAs and associated differentially expressed gene targets.MethodsIn this study, we have utilized large-scale, longitudinal, and deep RNA-seq data from two independent cohorts, namely the Parkinson's Progression Marker Initiative (PPMI) and the Parkinson's Disease Biomarker Program (PDBP), to characterize circRNA expression in patients of early PD stage.ResultsWe identified six circRNAs significantly differentially expressed in whole blood samples obtained from PD patients over time. Additionally, we were able to map a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network with potential downstream miRNA-mRNA targets and, with the help of co-expression analysis, to identify genes associated with PD progression. Our findings provide compelling evidence for a dysregulated circRNA interactome as an indicator of PD progression, with changes in the expression of these circRNAs and downstream gene targets being significantly associated with changes in UPDRS III scores in PD patients.ConclusionsOur results strongly indicate the association of circular RNAs with PD progression and emphasize its significance as a critical molecular marker. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are stable RNA molecules, some of which have been linked to cellular processes involved in neurodegenerative diseases. Their role in Parkinson's disease (PD) progression has not been well explored. In this study, we analyzed blood samples from 168 people with early-stage PD and 76 healthy individuals using RNA sequencing data from two large research programs, PPMI and PDBP. We identified six circRNAs that were significantly dysregulated over time in early-stage PD patients from both cohorts. Furthermore, changes in expression levels of these circRNAs could help predict disease progression based on UPDRS III (On) scores with reasonable accuracy (AUC of 0.693 [0.594–0.792]). We also explored how these circRNAs might influence gene regulation through microRNA (miRNA) sponging, identifying a circRNA-miRNA-mRNA network linked to PD-associated pathways. Our findings suggest that these circRNAs could serve as potential biomarkers for tracking PD progression and provide insights into its molecular mechanisms.

A personalized metabolic modelling approach through integrated analysis of RNA-Seq-based genomic variants and gene expression levels in Alzheimer's disease.	Generating condition-specific metabolic models by mapping gene expression data to genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs) is a routine approach to elucidate disease mechanisms from a metabolic perspective. On the other hand, integrating variants that perturb enzyme functionality from the same RNA-seq data may enhance GEM accuracy, offering insights into genome-wide metabolic pathology. Our study pioneers the extraction of both transcriptomic and genomic data from the same RNA-seq data to reconstruct personalized metabolic models. We map genes with significantly higher load of pathogenic variants in Alzheimer's disease (AD) onto a human GEM together with the gene expression data. Comparative analysis of the resulting personalized patient metabolic models with the control models shows enhanced accuracy in detecting AD-associated metabolic pathways compared to the case where only expression data is mapped on the GEM. Besides, several otherwise would-be missed pathways are annotated in AD by considering the effect of genomic variants.

The interplay between age at menopause and synaptic integrity on Alzheimer's disease risk in women.	Menopause is a major biological transition that may influence women's late-life brain health. Earlier estrogen depletion-via earlier menopause-has been associated with increased risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Synaptic dysfunction also incites and exacerbates AD progression. We investigated whether age at menopause and synaptic health together influence AD neuropathology and cognitive trajectories using clinical and autopsy data from 268 female decedents in the Rush Memory and Aging Project. We observed significant interactions between age at menopause and synaptic integrity on cognitive decline and tau tangles, such that earlier menopause strengthened the associations of reduced synaptic integrity with faster cognitive decline and elevated tau. Exploratory analyses showed that these relationships were attenuated in women who took menopausal hormone therapy. These findings suggest that midlife endocrine processes or their sequalae may influence synaptic vulnerability to AD. Interventions addressing both hormonal factors and synaptic health could enhance resilience to dementia in women.

Structural variants linked to Alzheimer's disease and other common age-related clinical and neuropathologic traits.	BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder with substantial genetic influence. While genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified numerous risk loci for late-onset AD (LOAD), the functional mechanisms underlying most of these associations remain unresolved. Large genomic rearrangements, known as structural variants (SVs), represent a promising avenue for elucidating such mechanisms within some of these loci. METHODS: By leveraging data from two ongoing cohort studies of aging and dementia, the Religious Orders Study and Rush Memory and Aging Project (ROS/MAP), we performed genome-wide association analysis testing 20,205 common SVs from 1088 participants with whole genome sequencing (WGS) data. A range of Alzheimer's disease and other common age-related clinical and neuropathologic traits were examined. RESULTS: First, we mapped SVs across 81 AD risk loci and discovered 22 SVs in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with GWAS lead variants and directly associated with the phenotypes tested. The strongest association was a deletion of an Alu element in the 3'UTR of the TMEM106B gene, in high LD with the respective AD GWAS locus and associated with multiple AD and AD-related disorders (ADRD) phenotypes, including tangles density, TDP-43, and cognitive resilience. The deletion of this element was also linked to lower TMEM106B protein abundance. We also found a 22-kb deletion associated with depression in ROS/MAP and bearing similar association patterns as GWAS SNPs at the IQCK locus. In addition, we leveraged our catalog of SV-GWAS to replicate and characterize independent findings in SV-based GWAS for AD and five other neurodegenerative diseases. Among these findings, we highlight the replication of genome-wide significant SVs for progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), including markers for the 17q21.31 MAPT locus inversion and a 1483-bp deletion at the CYP2A13 locus, along with other suggestive associations, such as a 994-bp duplication in the LMNTD1 locus, suggestively linked to AD and a 3958-bp deletion at the DOCK5 locus linked to Lewy body disease (LBD) (P = 3.36 × 10 CONCLUSIONS: While still limited in sample size, this study highlights the utility of including analysis of SVs for elucidating mechanisms underlying GWAS loci and provides a valuable resource for the characterization of the effects of SVs in neurodegenerative disease pathogenesis.

Human herpesvirus-associated transposable element activation in human aging brains with Alzheimer's disease.	INTRODUCTION: Human herpesvirus (HHV) has been linked to Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. METHODS: We leveraged functional genomics data from Religious Orders Study or the Rush Memory and Aging Project (ROS/MAP) and Mount Sinai Brain Bank (MSBB) brain biobanks and single-cell RNA-sequencing data from HHV-infected forebrain organoids to investigate HHV-infection-associated transposable element (TE) dysregulation underlying AD etiologies. RESULTS: We identified widespread TE dysregulation in HHV-positive human AD brains, including an astrocyte-specific upregulation of LINE1 subfamily TEs in HHV-positive human AD brains. We further pinpointed astrocyte-specific LINE1 upregulation that could potentially regulate target gene NEAT1 expression via long-range enhancer-promoter chromatin interactions. This LINE1 dysregulation can be partially reversed by the usage of anti-HHV drugs (valacyclovir and acyclovir) in a virus-infected human brain organoid model. Finally, we demonstrated that valacyclovir rescued tau-associated neuropathology and alleviated LINE1 activation in an experimental tau aggregation model. DISCUSSION: Our analysis provides associations linking molecular, clinical, and neuropathological AD features with HHV infection, which warrants future clinical validation. HIGHLIGHTS: Via analysis of bulk RNA-seq data in two large-scale human brain biobanks, ROS/MAP (n = 109 pathologically confirmed AD and n = 44 cognitively healthy controls) and MSBB (n = 284 AD and n = 150 cognitively healthy controls), we identified widespread TE activation in HHV-positive human AD brains and significantly positive associations of HHV RNA abundance with APOE4 genotype, Braak staging score, and CERAD score. We identified cell type-specific LINE1 upregulation in both microglia and astrocytes of human AD brains via long-range enhancer-promoter chromatin interactions on lncRNA nuclear enriched abundant transcript 1 (NEAT1). We determined that usage of valacyclovir and acyclovir was significantly associated with reduced incidence of AD in a large real-world patient database. Using the HEK293 tau P301S model and U2OS mt-Keima cell model, we determined that valacyclovir treatment rescued tau-associated neuropathology and alleviated activation of LINE1 with increased cellular autophagy-level mechanistically supported clinical benefits of valacyclovir in real-world patient data.

In Alzheimer's disease (AD), microglia form distinct cellular aggregates that play critical roles in disease progression, including Aβ plaque-associated microglia (PaM) and the newly identified coffin-like microglia (CoM). PaM are closely associated with amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques, while CoM are enriched in the pyramidal layer of the CA2/CA1 hippocampal subfields, where they frequently engulf neurons and associate with tau-positive tangles and phosphorylated α-synuclein. To elucidate the role of these microglial subtypes, we employed high-content neuropathology, integrating Deep Spatial Profiling (DSP), multiplex chromogenic immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy, to comprehensively map and characterise their morphological and molecular signatures, as well as their neuropathological and astrocytic microenvironments, in AD and control post-mortem samples. PaM and PaM-associated astrocytes exhibited signatures related to complement system pathways, ErbB signalling, and metabolic and neurodegenerative processes. In contrast, CoM displayed markers associated with protein degradation and immune signalling pathways, including STING, TGF-β, and NF-κB. While no direct association between CD8 + T cells and either microglial type was observed, CD163 + perivascular macrophages were frequently incorporated into PaM. These findings provide novel insights into the heterogeneity of microglial responses, in particular their distinct interactions with astrocytes and infiltrating immune cells, and shed light on specific neurodegenerative hotspots and their implications for hippocampal deterioration in AD.

Review of Associations of Diabetes and Insulin Resistance With Brain Health in Three Harmonised Cohort Studies of Ageing and Dementia.	Diabetes increases the risk of dementia, and insulin resistance (IR) has emerged as a potential unifying feature. Here, we review published findings over the past 2 decades on the relation of diabetes and IR to brain health, including those related to cognition and neuropathology, in the Religious Orders Study, the Rush Memory and Aging Project, and the Minority Aging Research Study (ROS/MAP/MARS), three harmonised cohort studies of ageing and dementia at the Rush Alzheimer's Disease Center (RADC). A wide range of participant data, including information on medical conditions such as diabetes and neuropsychological tests, as well as other clinical and laboratory-based data collected annually. Neuropathology data are collected in participants who agree to autopsy at death. Recent studies have measured additional peripheral and brain IR data, including multi-omics. This review summarises findings from the RADC cohort studies that investigate the relation of diabetes and IR in older adults to cognition, neuropathology, omics in dementia, and other brain health measures. Examining the risk of clinically diagnosed dementia in older adults, our study found a 65% increased risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia in individuals with diabetes compared with those without. Regarding cognitive function, we have consistently observed associations of diabetes, as well as both peripheral and brain IR, with worse and declining performance in global cognition and specific cognitive domains, particularly semantic memory and perceptual speed. Studies utilising neuropathological data showed associations of diabetes and peripheral IR with brain infarcts, while brain IR measures, notably alpha serine/threonine-protein kinase1 (AKT1), were associated with both brain infarcts and AD pathology. Multi-omics studies suggested shared causal genes and pathways between diabetes and dementia. Recent epigenetic studies have revealed associations between IR and AD risk, along with distinct 5-hydroxymethylcytosine signatures in diabetes-associated AD. Furthermore, our studies have utilised other available data to investigate the impact of diabetes on neurological outcomes other than cognition and reported worsening of parkinsonian-like signs in diabetes. Recent studies have also explored risk factors for diabetes and have reported associations between lower literacy and decision-making abilities with elevated haemoglobin A1C levels, a peripheral IR measure. Overall, our findings, as summarised in this review, illustrate a range of mechanistic and other insights into the complex relationship of diabetes and IR with brain health. These findings may have important implications for future research on the ageing brain, including the prevention of cognitive decline and dementia in persons at risk for or with diabetes.

Uncovering the epigenetic regulatory clues of PRRT1 in Alzheimer's disease: a strategy integrating multi-omics analysis with explainable machine learning.	BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder with a largely unexplored epigenetic landscape. OBJECTIVE: This study employs an innovative approach that integrates multi-omics analysis and explainable machine learning to explore the epigenetic regulatory mechanisms underlying the epigenetic signature of PRRT1 implicated in AD. METHODS: Through comprehensive DNA methylation and transcriptomic profiling, we identified distinct epigenetic signatures associated with gene PRRT1 expression in AD patient samples compared to healthy controls. Utilizing interpretable machine learning models and ELMAR analysis, we dissected the complex relationships between these epigenetic signatures and gene expression patterns, revealing novel regulatory elements and pathways. Finally, the epigenetic mechanisms of these genes were investigated experimentally. RESULTS: This study identified ten epigenetic signatures, constructed an interpretable AD diagnostic model, and utilized various bioinformatics methods to create an epigenomic map. Subsequently, the ELMAR R package was used to integrate multi-omics data and identify the upstream transcription factor MAZ for PRRT1. Finally, experiments confirmed the interaction between MAZ and PRRT1, which mediated apoptosis and autophagy in AD. CONCLUSION: This study adopts a strategy that integrates bioinformatics analysis with molecular experiments, providing new insights into the epigenetic regulatory mechanisms of PRRT1 in AD and demonstrating the importance of explainable machine learning in elucidating complex disease mechanisms.

Neuropathology-based approach reveals novel Alzheimer's Disease genes and highlights female-specific pathways and causal links to disrupted lipid metabolism: insights into a vicious cycle.	Dementia refers to an umbrella phenotype of many different underlying pathologies with Alzheimer's disease (AD) being the most common type. Neuropathological examination remains the gold standard for accurate AD diagnosis, however, most that we know about AD genetics is based on Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) of clinically defined AD. Such studies have identified multiple AD susceptibility variants with a significant portion of the heritability unexplained and highlighting the phenotypic and genetic heterogeneity of the clinically defined entity. Furthermore, despite women's increased susceptibility to dementia, there is a lack of sex-specific genetic studies and understanding of sex-specific background for the disorder. Here, we aim to tackle the heterogeneity of AD by specifically concentrating on neuropathological features and pursuing sex-specific analysis. We bring together 14 different genomic and neuropathology datasets (6960 individuals) and we integrate our GWAS findings with transcriptomic and phenotypic data aiming to also identify biomarkers for AD progression. We uncover novel genetic associations to AD neuropathology, including BIN1 and OPCML. Our sex-specific analysis points to a role for BIN1 specifically in women as well as novel AD loci including QRFPR and SGCZ. Post-GWAS analyses illuminate the functional and biological mechanisms underlying AD and reveal sex-specific differences. Finally, through PheWAS and Mendelian Randomization analysis, we identify causal links with AD neuropathology pointing to disrupted lipid metabolism, as well as impaired peripheral immune response and liver dysfunction as part of a vicious cycle that fuels neurodegeneration.

Leveraging functional annotations to map rare variants associated with Alzheimer's disease with gruyere.	The increasing availability of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) has begun to elucidate the contribution of rare variants (RVs), both coding and non-coding, to complex disease. Multiple RV association tests are available to study the relationship between genotype and phenotype, but most are restricted to per-gene models and do not fully leverage the availability of variant-level functional annotations. We propose Genome-wide Rare Variant EnRichment Evaluation (gruyere), a Bayesian probabilistic model that complements existing methods by learning global, trait-specific weights for functional annotations to improve variant prioritization. We apply gruyere to WGS data from the Alzheimer's Disease (AD) Sequencing Project, consisting of 7,966 cases and 13,412 controls, to identify AD-associated genes and annotations. Growing evidence suggests that disruption of microglial regulation is a key contributor to AD risk, yet existing methods have not had sufficient power to examine rare non-coding effects that incorporate such cell-type specific information. To address this gap, we 1) use predicted enhancer and promoter regions in microglia and other potentially relevant cell types (oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, and neurons) to define per-gene non-coding RV test sets and 2) include cell-type specific variant effect predictions (VEPs) as functional annotations. gruyere identifies 15 significant genetic associations not detected by other RV methods and finds deep learning-based VEPs for splicing, transcription factor binding, and chromatin state are highly predictive of functional non-coding RVs. Our study establishes a novel and robust framework incorporating functional annotations, coding RVs, and cell-type associated non-coding RVs, to perform genome-wide association tests, uncovering AD-relevant genes and annotations.

Deep learning reveals pathology-confirmed neuroimaging signatures in Alzheimer's, vascular and Lewy body dementias.	Concurrent neurodegenerative and vascular pathologies pose a diagnostic challenge in the clinical setting, with histopathology remaining the definitive modality for dementia-type diagnosis. To address this clinical challenge, we introduce a neuropathology-based, data-driven, multi-label deep-learning framework to identify and quantify in vivo biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease (AD), vascular dementia (VD) and Lewy body dementia (LBD) using antemortem T1-weighted MRI scans of 423 demented and 361 control participants from National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center and Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative datasets. Based on the best-performing deep-learning model, explainable heat maps were extracted to visualize disease patterns, and the novel Deep Signature of Pathology Atrophy REcognition (DeepSPARE) indices were developed, where a higher DeepSPARE score indicates more brain alterations associated with that specific pathology. A substantial discrepancy in clinical and neuropathological diagnosis was observed in the demented patients: 71% had more than one pathology, but 67% were diagnosed clinically as AD only. Based on these neuropathological diagnoses and leveraging cross-validation principles, the deep-learning model achieved the best performance, with a balanced accuracy of 0.844, 0.839 and 0.623 for AD, VD and LBD, respectively, and was used to generate the explainable deep-learning heat maps and DeepSPARE indices. The explainable deep-learning heat maps revealed distinct neuroimaging brain alteration patterns for each pathology: (i) the AD heat map highlighted bilateral hippocampal regions; (ii) the VD heat map emphasized white matter regions; and (iii) the LBD heat map exposed occipital alterations. The DeepSPARE indices were validated by examining their associations with cognitive testing and neuropathological and neuroimaging measures using linear mixed-effects models. The DeepSPARE-AD index was associated with Mini-Mental State Examination, the Trail Making Test B, memory, hippocampal volume, Braak stages, Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD) scores and Thal phases [false-discovery rate (FDR)-adjusted P < 0.05]. The DeepSPARE-VD index was associated with white matter hyperintensity volume and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (FDR-adjusted P < 0.001), and the DeepSPARE-LBD index was associated with Lewy body stages (FDR-adjusted P < 0.05). The findings were replicated in an out-of-sample Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative dataset by testing associations with cognitive, imaging, plasma and CSF measures. CSF and plasma tau phosphorylated at threonine-181 (pTau181) were significantly associated with DeepSPARE-AD in the AD and mild cognitive impairment amyloid-β positive (AD/MCIΑβ+) group (FDR-adjusted P < 0.001), and CSF α-synuclein was associated solely with DeepSPARE-LBD (FDR-adjusted P = 0.036). Overall, these findings demonstrate the advantages of our innovative deep-learning framework in detecting antemortem neuroimaging signatures linked to different pathologies. The newly deep-learning-derived DeepSPARE indices are precise, pathology-sensitive and single-valued non-invasive neuroimaging metrics, bridging the traditional widely available in vivo T1 imaging with histopathology.

Association of ten VEGF family genes with Alzheimer's disease endophenotypes at single cell resolution.	INTRODUCTION: Using a single-nucleus transcriptome derived from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of 424 Religious Orders Study and the Rush Memory and Aging Project (ROS/MAP) participants, we investigated the cell type-specific effect of ten vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) genes on Alzheimer's disease (AD) endophenotypes. METHODS: Negative binomial mixed models were used for differential gene expression and association analysis with AD endophenotypes. VEGF-associated intercellular communication was also profiled. RESULTS: Higher microglia FLT1, endothelial FLT4, and oligodendrocyte VEGFB are associated with greater amyloid beta (Aβ) load, whereas higher VEGFB expression in inhibitory neurons is associated with lower Aβ load. Higher astrocyte NRP1 is associated with lower tau density. Higher microglia and endothelial FLT1 are associated with worse cognition performance. Endothelial and microglial FLT1 expression was upregulated in clinical AD patients compared to cognitively normal controls. Finally, AD cells showed a significant reduction in VEGF signaling compared to controls. DISCUSSION: Our results highlight key changes in VEGF receptor expression in endothelial and microglial cells during AD, and the potential protective role of VEGFB in neurons. HIGHLIGHTS: The prefrontal cortical expression of FLT1 and FLT4 was associated with worse cross-sectional global cognitive function, longitudinal cognitive trajectories, and more Alzheimer's disease (AD) neuropathology. The associations between FLT1 or FLT4 and AD endophenotypes appear to be driven by endothelial and microglial cells. VEGFB expression seems to have opposing effects on the Aβ burden in AD depending on cell types, highlighting its potential protective role in neurons.

Cerebral amyloid angiopathy impacts neurofibrillary tangle burden and cognition.	Cerebral amyloid angiopathy commonly co-occurs with amyloid β plaques and neurofibrillary degeneration and is proposed to contribute to cognitive impairment. However, the interplay among these pathologic changes of Alzheimer disease is not well understood. Here we replicate and extend findings of a recent study that suggested the association of cerebral amyloid angiopathy and cognitive impairment is mediated by neurofibrillary degeneration. We employed similar approaches but in a larger, clinical-based (as opposed to community-based) set of 4915 autopsied National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center participants (60% with dementia). Neuropathologic lesions were measured ordinally; longitudinal change in cognition was used to measure cognitive impairment.

Pathologic and clinical correlates of region-specific brain GFAP in Alzheimer's disease.	Plasma glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) is an emerging biomarker of Alzheimer's disease (AD), with higher blood GFAP levels linked to faster cognitive decline, particularly among individuals with high brain amyloid burden. However, few studies have examined brain GFAP expression to clarify if peripheral associations reflect brain changes. This study aimed to correlate region-specific GFAP mRNA expression (n = 917) and protein abundance (n=386) with diverse neuropathological measures at autopsy in the Religious Orders Study and Rush Memory and Aging Project (ROS/MAP) and to characterize the interaction between brain GFAP and brain amyloid burden on downstream outcomes. We assessed GFAP gene expression in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, caudate nucleus, and posterior cingulate cortex with respect to core AD pathology (amyloid-β and tau), cerebrovascular (microinfarcts, macroinfarcts, and cerebral amyloid angiopathy [CAA]), proteinopathic (TDP-43, Lewy bodies), and cognitive outcomes. These associations were further examined at the protein level using tandem-mass tag proteomic measurements from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. We also assessed GFAP interactions with AD neuropathology on downstream outcomes. Cortical GFAP gene and protein expression were significantly upregulated in participants with a neuropathologically confirmed AD diagnosis at autopsy (all P	Alzheimer’s disease; Astrocytes; Biomarkers; GFAP; Proteomics; Transcriptomics

BACKGROUND: Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are critical regulators of physiological and pathological processes, with their dysregulation increasingly implicated in aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD). To investigate the spatial and cellular distribution of lncRNAs in the aging brain, we leveraged published spatial transcriptomics (ST), single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq), and bulk RNA-seq datasets from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) of ROSMAP participants with and without pathological AD. RESULTS: LncRNAs exhibited greater subregion-specific expression than mRNAs, with enrichment in antisense and lincRNA biotypes. Subregion-enriched lncRNAs were generally not cell-type specific, and vice versa. Differential expression analysis of ST data identified AD-associated lncRNAs with distinct spatial patterns and moderate overlap with differentially expressed (DE) lncRNAs from bulk RNA-seq. Gene set enrichment revealed their involvement in chromatin remodeling, epigenetic regulation, and RNA metabolism. We also identified AD DE lncRNAs across major brain cell types using snRNA-seq but overlap with ST DE lncRNAs was limited. Among previously reported lncRNAs, CONCLUSIONS: This study provides a spatial and cellular map of lncRNAs in the aging human cortex and identifies subregion-and cell-type-enriched DE lncRNAs in AD.

A Map of Transcriptomic Signatures of Different Brain Areas in Alzheimer's Disease.	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that progressively involves brain regions with an often-predictable pattern. Damage to the brain appears to spread and worsen with time, but the molecular mechanisms underlying the region-specific distribution of AD pathology at different stages of the disease are still under-investigated. In this study, a whole-transcriptome analysis was carried out on brain samples from the hippocampus (HI), temporal and parietal cortices (TC and PC, respectively), cingulate cortex (CG), and substantia nigra (SN) of six subjects with a definite AD diagnosis and three healthy age-matched controls in duplicate. The transcriptomic results showed a greater number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the TC (1571) and CG (1210) and a smaller number of DEGs in the HI (206), PC (109), and SN (60). Furthermore, the GSEA showed a difference between the group of brain areas affected early (HI and TC) and the group of areas that were subsequently involved (PC, CG, and SN). Notably, in the HI and TC, there was a significant downregulation of shared DEGs primarily involved in synaptic transmission, while in the PC, CG, and SN, there was a significant downregulation of genes primarily involved in protein folding and trafficking. The course of AD could follow a definite time- and severity-related pattern that arises from protein misfolding, as observed in the PC, CG, and SN, and leads to synaptic impairment, as observed in the HI and TC. Therefore, a map of the molecular and biological processes involved in AD pathogenesis may be traced. This could aid in the discovery of novel biological targets in order to develop effective and well-timed therapeutic approaches.

Bibliometric and visual analysis of single-cell multiomics in neurodegenerative disease arrest studies.	"BACKGROUND: Neurodegenerative diseases are progressive disorders that severely diminish the quality of life of patients. However, research on neurodegenerative diseases needs to be refined and deepened. Single-cell polyomics is a technique for obtaining transcriptomic, proteomic, and other information from a single cell. In recent years, the heat of single-cell multiomics as an emerging research tool for brain science has gradually increased. Therefore, the aim of this study was to analyze the current status and trends of studies related to the application of single-cell multiomics in neurodegenerative diseases through bibliometrics. RESULT: A total of 596 publications were included in the bibliometric analysis. Between 2015 and 2022, the number of publications increased annually, with the total number of citations increasing significantly, exhibiting the fastest rate of growth between 2019 and 2022. The country/region collaboration map shows that the United States has the most publications and cumulative citations, and that China and the United States have the most collaborations. The institutions that produced the greatest number of articles were Harvard Medical School, Skupin, Alexander, and Wiendl. Among the authors, Heinz had the highest output. Mathys, H accumulated the most citations and was the authoritative author in the field. The journal Nature Communications has published the most literature in this field. A keyword analysis reveals that neurodegenerative diseases and lesions (e.g., Alzheimer's disease, amyloid beta) are the core and foundation of the field. Conversely, single-cell multiomics related research (e.g., single-cell RNA sequencing, bioinformatics) and brain nerve cells (e.g., microglia, astrocytes, neural stem cells) are the hot frontiers of this specialty. Among the references, the article ""Single-cell transcriptomic analysis of Alzheimer's disease"" is the most frequently cited (1,146 citations), and the article ""Cell types in the mouse cortex and hippocampus revealed by single-cell RNA-seq"" was the most cited article in the field. CONCLUSION: The objective of this study is to employ bibliometric methods to visualize studies related to single-cell multiomics in neurodegenerative diseases. This will enable us to summarize the current state of research and to reveal key trends and emerging hotspots in the field."	cell heterogeneity; microglia; neurodegenerative disease; neuroscience; single-cell RNA sequencing

A multilayer network analysis of Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis: Roles for p-tau, synaptic peptides, and physical activity.	INTRODUCTION: In the aging brain, cognitive abilities emerge from the coordination of complex pathways arising from a balance between protective lifestyle and environmental factors and accumulation of neuropathologies. METHODS: As part of the Rush Memory and Aging Project (n = 440), we measured accelerometer-based actigraphy, cognitive performance, and after brain autopsy, selected reaction monitoring mass spectrometry. Multilevel network analysis was used to examine the relationships among the molecular machinery of vesicular neurotransmission, Alzheimer's disease (AD) neuropathology, cognition, and late-life physical activity. RESULTS: Synaptic peptides involved in neuronal secretory function were the most influential contributors to the multilayer network, reflecting the complex interdependencies among AD pathology, synaptic processes, and late-life cognition. Older adults with lower physical activity evidenced stronger adverse relationships among phosphorylated tau peptides, markers of synaptic integrity, and tangle pathology. DISCUSSION: Network-based approaches simultaneously model interdependent biological processes and advance understanding of the role of physical activity in age-associated cognitive impairment. HIGHLIGHTS: Network-based approaches simultaneously model interdependent biological processes. Secretory synaptic peptides were influential contributors to the multilayer network. Older adults with lower physical activity had adverse relationships among pathology. There was interdependence among phosphorylated tau, synaptic integrity, and tangles. Network methods elucidate the role of physical activity in cognitive impairment.	Alzheimer's disease; aging; physical activity; post mortem brain; presynaptic proteins; proteomics; synaptopathy

Here we performed GWAS on 11 ADRD-related neuropathology endophenotypes with participants drawn from the following three sources: the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center, the Religious Orders Study and Rush Memory and Aging Project, and the Adult Changes in Thought study (n = 7,804 total autopsied participants). We identified eight independent significantly associated loci, of which four were new (COL4A1, PIK3R5, LZTS1 and APOC2). Separately testing known ADRD loci, 19 loci were significantly associated with at least one neuropathology after false-discovery rate adjustment. Genetic colocalization analyses identified pleiotropic effects and quantitative trait loci. Methylation in the cerebral cortex at two sites near APOC2 was associated with cerebral amyloid angiopathy. Studies that include neuropathology endophenotypes are an important step in understanding the mechanisms underlying genetic ADRD risk.

Cognitive resilience to Alzheimer's disease characterized by cell-type abundance.	INTRODUCTION: The molecular basis of cognitive resilience (CR) among pathologically confirmed Alzheimer's disease (AD) cases is not well understood. METHODS: Abundance of 13 cell types and neuronal subtypes in brain bulk RNA-seq data from the anterior caudate, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) obtained from 434 AD cases, 318 cognitively resilient AD cases, and 188 controls in the Religious Orders Study and Rush Memory and Aging Project was estimated by deconvolution. RESULTS: PVALB+ neuron abundance was negatively associated with cognitive status and tau pathology in the DLPFC and PCC (P DISCUSSION: High abundance of PVALB+ neurons may be a marker of CR. TMEM106B variants may influence CR independent of AD pathology. HIGHLIGHTS: Neuron retention and a lack of astrocytosis are highly predictive of Alzheimer's disease (AD) resilience. PVALB+ GABAergic and RORB+ glutamatergic neurons are associated with cognitive status. A TMEM106B single nucleotide polymorphism is related to lower AD risk, higher neuron count, and increased AD pathology.

Predicting Alzheimer's Cognitive Resilience Score: A Comparative Study of Machine Learning Models Using RNA-seq Data.	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an important research topic. While amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles are hallmark pathological features of AD, cognitive resilience (CR) is a phenomenon where cognitive function remains preserved despite the presence of these pathological features. This study aimed to construct and compare predictive machine learning models for CR scores using RNA-seq data from the Religious Orders Study and Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP) and Mount Sinai Brain Bank (MSBB) cohorts. We evaluated support vector regression (SVR), random forest, XGBoost, linear, and transformer-based models. The SVR model exhibited the best performance, with contributing genes identified using Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) scores, providing insights into biological pathways associated with CR. Finally, we developed a tool called the resilience gene analyzer (REGA), which visualizes SHAP scores to interpret the contributions of individual genes to CR. REGA is available at https://igcore.cloud/GerOmics/REsilienceGeneAnalyzer/.	Alzheimer’s disease; Shapley additive explanations; machine learning; resilience gene analyzer; transcriptomics

Loneliness, cerebrovascular and Alzheimer's disease pathology, and cognition.	INTRODUCTION: Loneliness has a rising public health impact, but research involving neuropathology and representative cohorts has been limited. METHODS: Inverse odds of selection weights were generalized from the autopsy sample of Rush Alzheimer's Disease Center cohorts (N = 680; 89 ± 9 years old; 25% dementia) to the US-representative Health and Retirement Study (N = 8469; 76 ± 7 years old; 5% dementia) to extend external validity. Regressions tested cross-sectional associations between loneliness and (1) Alzheimer's disease (AD) and cerebrovascular pathology; (2) five cognitive domains; and (3) relationships between pathology and cognition, adjusting for depression. RESULTS: In weighted models, greater loneliness was associated with microinfarcts, lower episodic and working memory in the absence of AD pathology, lower working memory in the absence of infarcts, a stronger association of infarcts with lower episodic memory, and a stronger association of microinfarcts with lower working and semantic memory. DISCUSSION: Loneliness may relate to AD through multiple pathways involving cerebrovascular pathology and cognitive reserve. HIGHLIGHTS: Loneliness was associated with worse cognition in five domains. Loneliness was associated with the presence of microinfarcts. Loneliness moderated cognition-neuropathology associations. Transportability methods can provide insight into selection bias.

Frequent Alzheimer's disease neuropathological change in patients with glioblastoma.	BACKGROUND: The incidence of brain cancer and neurodegenerative diseases is increasing with a demographic shift towards aging populations. Biological parallels have been observed between glioblastoma and Alzheimer's disease (AD), which converge on accelerated brain aging. Here, we aimed to map the cooccurrence of AD neuropathological change (ADNC) in the tumor-adjacent cortex of patients with glioblastoma. METHODS: Immunohistochemical screening of AD markers amyloid beta (Abeta), amyloid precursor protein (APP), and hyperphosphorylated tau (pTau) was conducted in 420 tumor samples of 205 patients. For each cortex area, we quantified ADNC, neurons, tumor cells, and microglia. RESULTS: Fifty-two percent of patients ( CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight the frequent presence of ADNC in the glioblastoma vicinity, which was linked to patient age and tumor location. The cooccurrence of AD and glioblastoma seemed stochastic without clear spatial relation. ADNC did not impact patient survival in our cohort.

Structural variants linked to Alzheimer's Disease and other common age-related clinical and neuropathologic traits.	Advances have led to a greater understanding of the genetics of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). However, the gap between the predicted and observed genetic heritability estimates when using single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and small indel data remains. Large genomic rearrangements, known as structural variants (SVs), have the potential to account for this missing genetic heritability. By leveraging data from two ongoing cohort studies of aging and dementia, the Religious Orders Study and Rush Memory and Aging Project (ROS/MAP), we performed genome-wide association analysis testing around 20,000 common SVs from 1,088 participants with whole genome sequencing (WGS) data. A range of Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders (AD/ADRD) clinical and pathologic traits were examined. Given the limited sample size, no genome-wide significant association was found, but we mapped SVs across 81 AD risk loci and discovered 22 SVs in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with GWAS lead variants and directly associated with AD/ADRD phenotypes (nominal

Parkinson's disease-associated shifts between DNA methylation and DNA hydroxymethylation in human brain in PD-related genes, including PARK19 (DNAJC6) and PTPRN2 (IA-2β).	BACKGROUND: The majority of Parkinson's disease (PD) cases are due to a complex interaction between aging, genetics, and environmental factors; epigenetic mechanisms are thought to act as important mediators of these risk factors. While multiple studies to date have explored the role of DNA modifications in PD, few focus on 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC). Because 5hmC occurs at its highest levels in the brain and is thought to be particularly important in the central nervous system, particularly in the response to neurotoxicants, it is important to explore the potential role of 5hmC in PD. This study expands on our previously published epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) performed on DNA isolated from neuron-enriched nuclei from human postmortem parietal cortex from the Banner Sun Health Research Institute Brain Bank. The study aimed to identify paired changes in 5hmC and 5mC in PD in enriched neuronal nuclei isolated from PD post-mortem parietal cortex and age- and sex-matched controls. We performed oxidative bisulfite (oxBS) conversion and paired it with our previously published bisulfite (BS)-based EWAS on the same samples to identify cytosines with significant shifts between these two related epigenetic marks. Interaction differentially modified cytosines (iDMCs) were identified using our recently published mixed-effects model for co-analyzing β RESULTS: We identified 1,030 iDMCs with paired changes in 5mC and 5hmC (FDR < 0.05) that map to 695 genes, including CONCLUSIONS: These data potentially link epigenetic regulation of the	DNA methylation; DNAJC6; Epigenetics; Epigenomics; PTPRN2; Parkinson disease

Revised criteria for diagnosis and staging of Alzheimer's disease: Alzheimer's Association Workgroup.	The National Institute on Aging and the Alzheimer's Association convened three separate work groups in 2011 and single work groups in 2012 and 2018 to create recommendations for the diagnosis and characterization of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The present document updates the 2018 research framework in response to several recent developments. Defining diseases biologically, rather than based on syndromic presentation, has long been standard in many areas of medicine (e.g., oncology), and is becoming a unifying concept common to all neurodegenerative diseases, not just AD. The present document is consistent with this principle. Our intent is to present objective criteria for diagnosis and staging AD, incorporating recent advances in biomarkers, to serve as a bridge between research and clinical care. These criteria are not intended to provide step-by-step clinical practice guidelines for clinical workflow or specific treatment protocols, but rather serve as general principles to inform diagnosis and staging of AD that reflect current science. HIGHLIGHTS: We define Alzheimer's disease (AD) to be a biological process that begins with the appearance of AD neuropathologic change (ADNPC) while people are asymptomatic. Progression of the neuropathologic burden leads to the later appearance and progression of clinical symptoms. Early-changing Core 1 biomarkers (amyloid positron emission tomography [PET], approved cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers, and accurate plasma biomarkers [especially phosphorylated tau 217]) map onto either the amyloid beta or AD tauopathy pathway; however, these reflect the presence of ADNPC more generally (i.e., both neuritic plaques and tangles). An abnormal Core 1 biomarker result is sufficient to establish a diagnosis of AD and to inform clinical decision making throughout the disease continuum. Later-changing Core 2 biomarkers (biofluid and tau PET) can provide prognostic information, and when abnormal, will increase confidence that AD is contributing to symptoms. An integrated biological and clinical staging scheme is described that accommodates the fact that common copathologies, cognitive reserve, and resistance may modify relationships between clinical and biological AD stages.

Integrated platform for multiscale molecular imaging and phenotyping of the human brain.	Understanding cellular architectures and their connectivity is essential for interrogating system function and dysfunction. However, we lack technologies for mapping the multiscale details of individual cells and their connectivity in the human organ-scale system. We developed a platform that simultaneously extracts spatial, molecular, morphological, and connectivity information of individual cells from the same human brain. The platform includes three core elements: a vibrating microtome for ultraprecision slicing of large-scale tissues without losing cellular connectivity (MEGAtome), a polymer hydrogel-based tissue processing technology for multiplexed multiscale imaging of human organ-scale tissues (mELAST), and a computational pipeline for reconstructing three-dimensional connectivity across multiple brain slabs (UNSLICE). We applied this platform for analyzing human Alzheimer's disease pathology at multiple scales and demonstrating scalable neural connectivity mapping in the human brain.

Orexin B protects dopaminergic neurons from 1-Methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine-induced neurotoxicity associated with reduced extracellular signal-regulated kinase phosphorylation.	BACKGROUND: The loss of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) is a major pathological hallmark of Parkinson's disease (PD). Orexin B (OXB) has been reported to promote the growth of DA neurons. However, the roles of OXB in the degeneration of DA neurons still remained not fully clear. METHODS: An in vivo PD model was constructed by administrating 1-Methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) in mice. Pole test was performed to investigate the motor function of mice and the number of DA neurons was detected by immunofluorescence (IF). A PD cell model was established by treating SH-SY5Y cells with 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+). OXB was added to the culture medium 2 h after MPP + treatment. Microscopic analysis was carried out to investigate the function of OXB in the cell model of PD 24 h after MPP + challenge. RNA-Seq analysis of the PD cell model was performed to explore the possible mechanisms. Western blot was used to detect the phosphorylation levels of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). RESULTS: OXB significantly decreased the DA neurons death caused by MPTP, alleviated MPP+-induced neurotoxicity in SH-SY5Y cells, and robustly enhanced the weight and motor ability of PD mice. Besides, RNA-Seq analysis demonstrated that the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway was involved in the pathology of PD. Furthermore, MPP + led to increased levels of phosphorylation of ERK (p-ERK), OXB treatment significantly decreased the levels of p-ERK in MPP+-treated SH-SY5Y cells. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that OXB exerts a neuroprotective role associated with reduced ERK phosphorylation in the PD model. This suggests that OXB may have therapeutic potential for treatment of PD.

Despite the presence of significant Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology, characterized by amyloid β (Aβ) plaques and phosphorylated tau (pTau) tangles, some cognitively normal elderly individuals do not inevitably develop dementia. These findings give rise to the notion of cognitive 'resilience', suggesting maintained cognitive function despite the presence of AD neuropathology, highlighting the influence of factors beyond classical pathology. Cortical astroglial inflammation, a ubiquitous feature of symptomatic AD, shows a strong correlation with cognitive impairment severity, potentially contributing to the diversity of clinical presentations. However, noninvasively imaging neuroinflammation, particularly astrogliosis, using MRI remains a significant challenge. Here we sought to address this challenge and to leverage multidimensional (MD) MRI, a powerful approach that combines relaxation with diffusion MR contrasts, to map cortical astrogliosis in the human brain by accessing sub-voxel information. Our goal was to test whether MD-MRI can map astroglial pathology in the cerebral cortex, and if so, whether it can distinguish cognitive resiliency from dementia in the presence of hallmark AD neuropathological changes. We adopted a multimodal approach by integrating histological and MRI analyses using human postmortem brain samples.

Platelet activation of protease-activated receptor 4 (PAR4) and thrombin are at the top of a chain of events leading to fibrin deposition, microinfarcts, blood-brain barrier disruption, and inflammation. We evaluated mRNA expression of the PAR4 gene F2RL3 in human brain and global cognitive performance in participants with and without cognitive impairment or dementia. Data were acquired from the Religious Orders Study (ROS) and the Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP). F2RL3 mRNA was elevated in AD cases and was associated with worse retrospective longitudinal cognitive performance. Moreover, F2RL3 expression interacted with clinical AD diagnosis on longitudinal cognition whereas this relationship was attenuated in individuals without cognitive impairment. Additionally, when adjusting for the effects of AD neuropathology, F2RL3 expression remained a significant predictor of cognitive decline. F2RL3 expression correlated positively with transcript levels of proinflammatory markers including TNFα, IL-1β, NFκB, and fibrinogen α/β/γ. Together, these results reveal that F2RL3 mRNA expression is associated with multiple AD-relevant outcomes and its encoded product, PAR4, may play a role in disease pathogenesis.

Variants in the MS4A cluster interact with soluble TREM2 expression on biomarkers of neuropathology.	Recent evidence suggests that Alzheimer's disease (AD) genetic risk variants (rs1582763 and rs6591561) of the MS4A locus are genome-wide significant regulators of soluble TREM2 levels such that the minor allele of the protective variant (rs1582763) is associated with higher sTREM2 and lower AD risk while the minor allele of (rs6591561) relates to lower sTREM2 and higher AD risk.

Association of Alzheimer's Disease and Other Neuropathologies With Functional Disability in Persons With and Without Dementia.	BACKGROUND: Dementia results from multiple neuropathologies causing cognitive impairment sufficiently severe to affect functional status. However, these pathologies and functional impairment are common in persons without dementia. We examined the association of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and multiple other neuropathologies with instrumental and basic activities of daily living in persons with and without dementia. METHODS: Participants were 1 509 deceased from the Religious Orders Study or Rush Memory and Aging Project. Pathologic AD and 3 other AD indices were examined, in addition to 4 non-AD neurodegenerative pathologies: cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), hippocampal sclerosis, TDP-43, and Lewy bodies, and 4 cerebrovascular pathologies: gross- and microinfarctions, athero- and arteriolosclerosis. Functional assessment included Lawton and Katz Index Instrumental and Basic Activities of Daily Living (IADL and BADL). Ordinal regression models adjusted for age, sex, and education were used to examine the association of neuropathologies with IADL and BADL. RESULTS: Alzheimer's disease and the other neuropathologies were associated with impaired IADL (all ps < .001) and with impaired BADL (ps < .01), except for atherosclerosis and CAA, which were not associated with BADL. The effects of most neuropathologies were largely affected by dementia. However, small effects on IADL remained for PHF-tau tangles after adjusting models for dementia. Direct effects of gross infarcts on IADL and BADL and of microinfarcts on BADL remained unchanged after adjusting the models for dementia. CONCLUSIONS: Alzheimer's disease and all other neuropathologies are strongly associated with functional disability. The association of most neuropathologies with disability was eliminated or attenuated by dementia, except for gross infarcts and microinfarcts.

Identification of diffusion, kurtosis, and propagator MRI markers of Alzheimer's disease pathology in post-mortem human tissue.	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an irreversible degenerative brain disease affecting 6.7 million Americans and while the hallmark AD pathologies of plaques and tangles follow a stereotyped progression during the course of the disease, clinical markers for early diagnosis are lacking and approximately 20% of all AD cases are ultimately misdiagnosed. Conventional clinical MRI is capable of reporting severe brain atrophy, but fails to recognize earlier biomarkers associated with more subtle cellular and molecular changes. Microstructural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) techniques are promising to address this challenge and may sensitively detect and distinguish tissue degeneration, tauopathies, and beta amyloid plaques to improve accuracy of diagnosis and enable early detection. The objective of this study was to identify and compare the most promising microstructural markers of AD pathology over a range of diffusion and relaxometry-based MRI techniques from conventional to advanced. To accomplish this, we performed MRI microscopy of post-mortem human temporal lobe specimens (n = 14) at high resolution and image quality and evaluated the relative influence of metrics across multiple microstructural MRI frameworks using principal component analysis (PCA). We performed additional correlation analysis between metrics identified by PCA and clinical neuropathology scores of Braak stage and plaque and tangle load. Hippocampal diffusion and restriction metrics contributed most to the first principal component, and the correlation with Braak score was positive for diffusivity and negative for restriction metrics. Additionally, the MAP-MRI propagator anisotropy (PA) metric of microscale anisotropy was strongly and negatively correlated with AD pathology while the conventional fractional anisotropy (FA) metric showed little or no correspondence and there was not a strong association between FA and PA by PCA. Entorhinal cortex findings were minimal except for reported increases in restriction due to plaque content. Taken together, our findings suggest that microstructural MRI metrics of restriction and diffusion are most prominent and may reflect degenerative processes in AD brain tissue and that microscale anisotropy may be more advantageous than conventional FA for the detection of subtle and earlier cellular changes in AD.

Profiles of Lifestyle Health Behaviors and Postmortem Dementia-Related Neuropathology.	High engagement in lifestyle health behaviors appears to be protective against cognitive decline in aging. We investigated the association between patterns of modifiable lifestyle health behaviors and common brain neuropathologies of dementia as a possible mechanism. We examined 555 decedents from the Rush Memory and Aging Project, free of dementia at their initial concurrent report of lifestyle health behaviors of interest (physical, social, and cognitive activities, and healthy diet), and who underwent a postmortem neuropathology evaluation. First, we used latent profile analysis to group participants based on baseline behavior patterns. Second, we assessed the associations of profile membership with each neurodegenerative (global Alzheimer's disease [AD] pathology, amyloid-beta load, density of neurofibrillary tangles, and presence of cortical Lewy bodies and TAR DNA-binding protein 43 cytoplasmic inclusions) and neurovascular pathologies (presence of chronic gross or microscopic infarcts, arteriolosclerosis, atherosclerosis, and cerebral amyloid angiopathy), using separate linear or logistic regression models, adjusted for age at death, sex (core model), vascular disease risk factors, and vascular conditions (fully adjusted model). Participants had either consistently lower (N = 224) or consistently higher (N = 331) engagement across 4 lifestyle health behaviors. We generally found no differences in neuropathologies between higher and lower engagement groups in core or fully adjusted models; for example, higher engagement in lifestyle health behaviors was not associated with global AD pathology after core or full adjustment (both p > .8). In conclusion, we found no evidence of associations between patterns of lifestyle health behaviors and neuropathology. Other mechanisms may underlie protective effects of health behaviors against dementia.	Dementia; Lifestyle; Neurodegeneration; Neuropathology; Vascular

Genetic associations with dementia-related proteinopathy: Application of item response theory.	INTRODUCTION: Although dementia-related proteinopathy has a strong negative impact on public health, and is highly heritable, understanding of the related genetic architecture is incomplete. METHODS: We applied multidimensional generalized partial credit modeling (GPCM) to test genetic associations with dementia-related proteinopathies. Data were analyzed to identify candidate single nucleotide variants for the following proteinopathies: Aβ, tau, α-synuclein, and TDP-43. RESULTS: Final included data comprised 966 participants with neuropathologic and WGS data. Three continuous latent outcomes were constructed, corresponding to TDP-43-, Aβ/Tau-, and α-synuclein-related neuropathology endophenotype scores. This approach helped validate known genotype/phenotype associations: for example, TMEM106B and GRN were risk alleles for TDP-43 pathology; and GBA for α-synuclein/Lewy bodies. Novel suggestive proteinopathy-linked alleles were also discovered, including several (SDHAF1, TMEM68, and ARHGEF28) with colocalization analyses and/or high degrees of biologic credibility. DISCUSSION: A novel methodology using GPCM enabled insights into gene candidates for driving misfolded proteinopathies. HIGHLIGHTS: Latent factor scores for proteinopathies were estimated using a generalized partial credit model. The three latent continuous scores corresponded well with proteinopathy severity. Novel genes associated with proteinopathies were identified. Several genes had high degrees of biologic credibility for dementia risk factors.

Associations of 24-Hour Rest-Activity Rhythm Fragmentation, Cognitive Decline, and Postmortem Locus Coeruleus Hypopigmentation in Alzheimer's Disease.	OBJECTIVE: While studies suggested that locus coeruleus (LC) neurodegeneration contributes to sleep-wake dysregulation in Alzheimer's disease (AD), the association between LC integrity and circadian rest-activity patterns remains unknown. Here, we investigated the relationships between 24-hour rest-activity rhythms, cognitive trajectories, and autopsy-derived LC integrity in older adults with and without cortical AD neuropathology. METHODS: This retrospective study leveraged multi-modal data from participants of the longitudinal clinical-pathological Rush Memory and Aging Project. Indices of 24-hour rest-activity rhythm fragmentation (intradaily variability) and stability (interdaily stability) were extracted from annual actigraphic recordings, and cognitive trajectories were computed from annual cognitive evaluations. At autopsy, LC neurodegeneration was determined by the presence of hypopigmentation, and cortical AD neuropathology was assessed. Contributions of comorbid pathologies (Lewy bodies, cerebrovascular pathology) were evaluated. RESULTS: Among the 388 cases included in the study sample (age at death = 92.1 ± 5.9 years; 273 women), 98 (25.3%) displayed LC hypopigmentation, and 251 (64.7%) exhibited cortical AD neuropathology. Logistic regression models showed that higher rest-activity rhythm fragmentation, measured up to ~7.1 years before death, was associated with increased risk to display LC neurodegeneration at autopsy (odds ratio [OR] = 1.46, 95% confidence interval [CI INTERPRETATION: These findings highlight the LC as a neurobiological correlate of sleep-wake dysregulation in AD, and further underscore the clinical relevance of monitoring rest-activity patterns for improved detection of at-risk individuals.

Brain structural indicators of β-amyloid neuropathology.	Recent efforts demonstrated the efficacy of identifying early-stage neuropathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) through lumbar puncture cerebrospinal fluid assessment and positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracer imaging. These methods are effective yet are invasive, expensive, and not widely accessible. We extend and improve the multiscale structural mapping (MSSM) procedure to develop structural indicators of β-amyloid neuropathology in preclinical AD, by capturing both macrostructural and microstructural properties throughout the cerebral cortex using a structural MRI. We find that the MSSM signal is regionally altered in clear positive and negative cases of preclinical amyloid pathology (N = 220) when cortical thickness alone or hippocampal volume is not. It exhibits widespread effects of amyloid positivity across the posterior temporal, parietal, and medial prefrontal cortex, surprisingly consistent with the typical pattern of amyloid deposition. The MSSM signal is significantly correlated with amyloid PET in almost half of the cortex, much of which overlaps with regions where beta-amyloid accumulates, suggesting it could provide a regional brain 'map' that is not available from systemic markers such as plasma markers.

CHRNA5 links chandelier cells to severity of amyloid pathology in aging and Alzheimer's disease.	Changes in high-affinity nicotinic acetylcholine receptors are intricately connected to neuropathology in Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Protective and cognitive-enhancing roles for the nicotinic α5 subunit have been identified, but this gene has not been closely examined in the context of human aging and dementia. Therefore, we investigate the nicotinic α5 gene CHRNA5 and the impact of relevant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in prefrontal cortex from 922 individuals with matched genotypic and post-mortem RNA sequencing in the Religious Orders Study and Memory and Aging Project (ROS/MAP). We find that a genotype robustly linked to increased expression of CHRNA5 (rs1979905A2) predicts significantly reduced cortical β-amyloid load. Intriguingly, co-expression analysis suggests CHRNA5 has a distinct cellular expression profile compared to other nicotinic receptor genes. Consistent with this prediction, single nucleus RNA sequencing from 22 individuals reveals CHRNA5 expression is disproportionately elevated in chandelier neurons, a distinct subtype of inhibitory neuron known for its role in excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) balance. We show that chandelier neurons are enriched in amyloid-binding proteins compared to basket cells, the other major subtype of PVALB-positive interneurons. Consistent with the hypothesis that nicotinic receptors in chandelier cells normally protect against β-amyloid, cell-type proportion analysis from 549 individuals reveals these neurons show amyloid-associated vulnerability only in individuals with impaired function/trafficking of nicotinic α5-containing receptors due to homozygosity of the missense CHRNA5 SNP (rs16969968A2). Taken together, these findings suggest that CHRNA5 and its nicotinic α5 subunit exert a neuroprotective role in aging and Alzheimer's disease centered on chandelier interneurons.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's dementia (AD) pathogenesis involves complex mechanisms, including microRNA (miRNA) dysregulation. Integrative network and machine learning analysis of miRNA can provide insights into AD pathology and prognostic/diagnostic biomarkers. METHODS: We performed co-expression network analysis to identify network modules associated with AD, its neuropathology markers, and cognition using brain tissue miRNA profiles from the Religious Orders Study and Rush Memory and Aging Project (ROS/MAP) (N = 702) as a discovery dataset. We performed association analysis of hub miRNAs with AD, its neuropathology markers, and cognition. After selecting target genes of the hub miRNAs, we performed association analysis of the hub miRNAs with their target genes and then performed pathway-based enrichment analysis. For replication, we performed a consensus miRNA co-expression network analysis using the ROS/MAP dataset and an independent dataset (N = 16) from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). Furthermore, we performed a machine learning approach to assess the performance of hub miRNAs for AD classification. RESULTS: Network analysis identified a glucose metabolism pathway-enriched module (M3) as significantly associated with AD and cognition. Five hub miRNAs (miR-129-5p, miR-433, miR-1260, miR-200a, and miR-221) of M3 had significant associations with AD clinical and/or pathologic traits, with miR129-5p by far the strongest across all phenotypes. Gene-set enrichment analysis of target genes associated with their corresponding hub miRNAs identified significantly enriched biological pathways including ErbB, AMPK, MAPK, and mTOR signaling pathways. Consensus network analysis identified two AD-associated consensus network modules and two hub miRNAs (miR-129-5p and miR-221). Machine learning analysis showed that the AD classification performance (area under the curve (AUC) = 0.807) of age, sex, and APOE ε4 carrier status was significantly improved by 6.3% with inclusion of five AD-associated hub miRNAs. CONCLUSIONS: Integrative network and machine learning analysis identified miRNA signatures, especially miR-129-5p, as associated with AD, its neuropathology markers, and cognition, enhancing our understanding of AD pathogenesis and leading to better performance of AD classification as potential diagnostic/prognostic biomarkers.

Human disease-specific cell signatures in non-lesional tissue in Multiple Sclerosis detected by single-cell and spatial transcriptomics.	"Recent investigations of cell type changes in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) using single-cell profiling methods have focused on active lesional and peri-lesional brain tissue, and have implicated a number of peripheral and central nervous system cell types. However, an important question is the extent to which so-called ""normal-appearing"" non-lesional tissue in individuals with MS accumulate changes over the lifespan. Here, we compared post-mortem non-lesional brain tissue from donors with a pathological or clinical diagnosis of MS from the Religious Orders Study or Rush Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP) cohorts to age- and sex-matched brains from persons without MS (controls). We profiled three brain regions using single-nucleus RNA-seq: dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), normal appearing white matter (NAWM) and the pulvinar in thalamus (PULV), from 15 control individuals, 8 individuals with MS, and 5 individuals with other detrimental pathologies accompanied by demyelination, resulting in a total of 78 samples. We identified region- and cell type-specific differences in non-lesional samples from individuals diagnosed with MS and/or exhibiting secondary demyelination with other neurological conditions, as compared to control donors. These differences included lower proportions of oligodendrocytes with expression of myelination related genes MOBP, MBP, PLP1, as well as higher proportions of CRYAB+ oligodendrocytes in all three brain regions. Among microglial signatures, we identified subgroups that were higher in both demyelination (TMEM163+/ERC2+), as well as those that were specifically higher in MS donors (HIF1A+/SPP1+) and specifically in donors with secondary demyelination (SOCS6+/MYO1E+), in both white and grey matter. To validate our findings, we generated Visium spatial transcriptomics data on matched tissue from 13 donors, and recapitulated our observations of gene expression differences in oligodendrocytes and microglia. Finally, we show that some of the differences observed between control and MS donors in NAWM mirror those previously reported between control WM and active lesions in MS donors. Overall, our investigation sheds additional light on cell type- and disease-specific differences present even in non-lesional white and grey matter tissue, highlighting widespread cellular signatures that may be associated with downstream pathological changes."

Multimodal lifestyle engagement patterns support cognitive stability beyond neuropathological burden.	BACKGROUND: Modifiable lifestyle behaviors account for a large proportion of dementia risk. However, the combined contributions of multidomain lifestyle patterns to cognitive aging are poorly understood, as most studies have examined individual lifestyle behaviors in isolation and without neuropathological characterization. This study examined data-driven patterns of lifestyle behaviors across multiple domains among older adults and tested their associations with disease-specific neuropathological burden and cognitive decline. METHODS: Participants included 2059 older adults enrolled in the longitudinal Memory and Aging Project (MAP) at the Rush Alzheimer's Disease Center; none of whom had dementia at baseline (73% no cognitive impairment (NCI), 27% mild cognitive impairment [MCI]). All participants completed cognitive testing annually. Lifestyle factors were measured during at least one visit and included (1) actigraphy-measured physical activity, as well as self-reported (2) sleep quality, (3) life space, (4) cognitive activities, (5) social activities, and (6) social network. A subset of participants (n = 791) had autopsy data for which burden of Alzheimer's disease (AD), cerebrovascular disease (CVD), Lewy body disease, and hippocampal sclerosis/TDP-43 was measured. Latent profile analysis across all 2059 participants identified distinct subgroups (i.e., classes) of lifestyle patterns. Linear mixed-effects models examined relationships between lifestyle classes and global cognitive trajectories, with and without covarying for all neuropathologies. Classes were also compared on rates of incident MCI/dementia. RESULTS: Five classes were identified: Class 1 CONCLUSIONS: Lifestyle behavior patterns among older adults account for differential rates of cognitive decline and clinical progression. Those with at least average engagement across all lifestyle domains exhibit greater cognitive stability after adjustment for neuropathology, highlighting the importance of engagement in multiple healthy lifestyle behaviors for later life cognitive health.

BACKGROUND: Enhancers are regulatory elements that target and modulate gene expression and play a role in human health and disease. However, the roles of enhancer regulatory circuit abnormalities driven by epigenetic alterations in Alzheimer's disease (AD) are unclear. METHODS: In this study, a multiomic integrative analysis was performed to map enhancer and chromatin accessibility landscapes and identify regulatory network abnormalities in AD. We identified differentially methylated enhancers and constructed regulatory networks across brain regions using AD brain tissue samples. Through the integration of snATAC-seq and snRNA-seq datasets, we mapped enhancers with DNA methylation alterations (DMA) and chromatin accessibility landscapes. Core regulatory triplets that contributed to AD neuropathology in specific cell types were further prioritized. RESULTS: We revealed widespread DNA methylation alterations (DMA) in the enhancers of AD patients across different brain regions. In addition, the genome-wide transcription factor (TF) binding profiles showed that enhancers with DMA are pervasively regulated by TFs. The TF-enhancer-gene regulatory network analysis identified core regulatory triplets that are associated with brain and immune cell proportions and play important roles in AD pathogenesis. Enhancer regulatory circuits with DMA exhibited distinct chromatin accessibility patterns, which were further characterized at single-cell resolutions. CONCLUSIONS: Our study comprehensively investigated DNA methylation-mediated regulatory circuit abnormalities and provided novel insights into the potential pathogenesis of AD.

Effects of copy number variations on longevity in late-onset Alzheimer's disease patients: insights from a causality network analysis.	Alzheimer's disease (AD), particularly late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD), is a prevalent form of dementia that significantly affects patients' cognitive and behavioral capacities and longevity. Although approximately 70 genetic risk factors linked with AD have been identified, their influence on patient longevity remains unclear. Further, recent studies have associated copy number variations (CNVs) with the longevity of healthy individuals and immune-related pathways in AD patients. This study aims to investigate the role of CNVs on the longevity of AD patients by integrating the Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) and transcriptomics data from the Religious Orders Study/Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP) cohort through causality network inference. Our comprehensive analysis led to the construction of a CNV-Gene-Age of Death (AOD) causality network. We successfully identified three key CNVs (DEL5006, mCNV14192, and DUP42180) and seven AD-longevity causal genes (	Alzheimer’s disease; causality network; copy number variation; longevity; plasminogen activation

A Mendelian Randomization-Based Causal Investigation on Bacterial Infection-Related Genes and Neurodegenerative Diseases.	Neurodegenerative diseases remain the most prevalent and unsolved health problems in human society, especially Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). The pathogenesis, pathology, and potential clinical treatments of neurodegenerative diseases still require in-depth research. In the wake of the association between pandemics and a growing number of neurodegeneration patients, there has been growing speculation that infections are linked to AD and PD. The Aβ peptide is an important causal-related biomarker of AD and is reported to share structural and functional similarities with certain antimicrobial peptides, suggesting that it has a role in eliciting an immune response against microbes. But how neurodegeneration is related to bacterial chronic infection has not been thoroughly investigated. Using the data from genome-wide association studies (GWAS), we performed Mendelian Randomization (MR) and map 7 genes in multiple bacterial infection pathways as exposure, which show a significant association with the outcome of AD or PD. As co-verification, we perform Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) on selected genetic variants incorporating their perturb-seq gene list (combining single-cell RNA-seq and CRISPR-based perturbations). We observed clustering of the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the upstream and downstream of AD and PD-related KEGG pathways, hence confirming their causal association with AD and PD and providing new perspectives on the true cause of neurodegeneration.

Integrative multi-omics analysis reveals the critical role of the PBXIP1 gene in Alzheimer's disease.	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder, and its strongest risk factor is aging. A few studies have explored the relationship between aging and AD, while the underlying mechanism remains unclear. We assembled data across multi-omics (i.e., epigenetics, transcriptomics, and proteomics, based on frozen tissues from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) and neuropathological and clinical traits from the Religious Orders Study and Rush Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP). Aging was assessed using six DNA methylation clocks (including the Horvath clock, Hannum clock, Levine clock, HorvathSkin clock, Lin clock, and Cortical clock) that capture mortality risk in literature. After accounting for age, we first identified a gene module (including 263 genes) that was related to the integrated aging measure of six clocks, as well as three neuropathological traits of AD (i.e., β-amyloid, Tau tangles, and tangle density). Interestingly, among 20 key genes with top intramodular connectivity of the module, PBXIP1 was the only one that was significantly associated with all three neuropathological traits of AD at the protein level after Bonferroni correction. Furthermore, PBXIP1 was associated with the clinical diagnosis of AD in both ROSMAP and three independent datasets. Moreover, PBXIP1 may be related to AD through its role in astrocytes and hippocampal neurons, and the mTOR pathway. The results suggest the critical role of PBXIP1 in AD and support the potential and feasibility of using multi-omics data to investigate mechanisms of complex diseases. However, more validations in different populations and experiments in vitro and in vivo are required in the future.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's dementia (AD) pathogenesis involves complex mechanisms, including microRNA (miRNA) dysregulation. Integrative network and machine learning analysis of miRNA can provide insights into AD pathology and prognostic/diagnostic biomarkers. METHODS: We performed co-expression network analysis to identify network modules associated with AD, its neuropathology markers, and cognition using brain tissue miRNA profiles from the Religious Orders Study and Rush Memory and Aging Project (ROS/MAP) (N = 702) as a discovery dataset. We performed association analysis of hub miRNAs with AD, its neuropathology markers, and cognition. After selecting target genes of the hub miRNAs, we performed association analysis of the hub miRNAs with their target genes and then performed pathway-based enrichment analysis. For replication, we performed a consensus miRNA co-expression network analysis using the ROS/MAP dataset and an independent dataset (N = 16) from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). Furthermore, we performed a machine learning approach to assess the performance of hub miRNAs for AD classification. RESULTS: Network analysis identified a glucose metabolism pathway-enriched module (M3) as significantly associated with AD and cognition. Five hub miRNAs (miR-129-5p, miR-433, miR-1260, miR-200a, and miR-221) of M3 had significant associations with AD clinical and/or pathologic traits, with miR129-5p by far the strongest across all phenotypes. Gene-set enrichment analysis of target genes associated with their corresponding hub miRNAs identified significantly enriched biological pathways including ErbB, AMPK, MAPK, and mTOR signaling pathways. Consensus network analysis identified two AD-associated consensus network modules, and two hub miRNAs (miR-129-5p and miR-221). Machine learning analysis showed that the AD classification performance (area under the curve (AUC) = 0.807) of age, sex, and CONCLUSIONS: Integrative network and machine learning analysis identified miRNA signatures, especially miR-129-5p, as associated with AD, its neuropathology markers, and cognition, enhancing our understanding of AD pathogenesis and leading to better performance of AD classification as potential diagnostic/prognostic biomarkers.

High-throughput digital quantification of Alzheimer disease pathology and associated infrastructure in large autopsy studies.	High-throughput digital pathology offers considerable advantages over traditional semiquantitative and manual methods of counting pathology. We used brain tissue from 5 clinical-pathologic cohort studies of aging; the Religious Orders Study, the Rush Memory and Aging Project, the Minority Aging Research Study, the African American Clinical Core, and the Latino Core to (1) develop a workflow management system for digital pathology processes, (2) optimize digital algorithms to quantify Alzheimer disease (AD) pathology, and (3) harmonize data statistically. Data from digital algorithms for the quantification of β-amyloid (Aβ, n = 413) whole slide images and tau-tangles (n = 639) were highly correlated with manual pathology data (r = 0.83 to 0.94). Measures were robust and reproducible across different magnifications and repeated scans. Digital measures for Aβ and tau-tangles across multiple brain regions reproduced established patterns of correlations, even when samples were stratified by clinical diagnosis. Finally, we harmonized newly generated digital measures with historical measures across multiple large autopsy-based studies. We describe a multidisciplinary approach to develop a digital pathology pipeline that reproducibly identifies AD neuropathologies, Aβ load, and tau-tangles. Digital pathology is a powerful tool that can overcome critical challenges associated with traditional microscopy methods.

Multi-tissue epigenetic analysis identifies distinct associations underlying insulin resistance and Alzheimer's disease at CPT1A locus.	BACKGROUND: Insulin resistance (IR) is a major risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia. The mechanisms by which IR predisposes to AD are not well-understood. Epigenetic studies may help identify molecular signatures of IR associated with AD, thus improving our understanding of the biological and regulatory mechanisms linking IR and AD. METHODS: We conducted an epigenome-wide association study of IR, quantified using the homeostatic model assessment of IR (HOMA-IR) and adjusted for body mass index, in 3,167 participants from the Framingham Heart Study (FHS) without type 2 diabetes at the time of blood draw used for methylation measurement. We identified DNA methylation markers associated with IR at the genome-wide level accounting for multiple testing (P < 1.1 × 10 RESULTS: We confirmed the strong association of blood DNA methylation with IR at three loci (cg17901584-DHCR24, cg17058475-CPT1A, cg00574958-CPT1A, and cg06500161-ABCG1). In FHS, higher levels of blood DNA methylation at cg00574958 and cg17058475 were both associated with lower IR (P = 2.4 × 10 CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest potentially distinct epigenetic regulatory mechanisms between peripheral blood and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex tissues underlying IR and AD at CPT1A locus.

The (in)visible Brazilians: A perspective review on the need for brain health and dementia research with Brazilian immigrants in the United States.	INTRODUCTION: The Brazilian population in the United States (U.S.), a Latinx subgroup, is rapidly growing and aging but remains underrepresented in U.S. health research. In addition to group-specific genetic and environmental risks, Brazilian immigrants and their offspring in the U.S. likely have cumulative risks for health inequities.It is estimated that 71% of Brazilian immigrants in the U.S. are undocumented, which may limit healthcare access/utilization. Furthermore, mental health is reported as a health priority by Brazilian immigrants in the U.S., and there is a lack of research on Alzheimer's disease and related dementia (AD/ADRD) in this population. METHODS: We reviewed the scientific literature using traditional (e.g., PubMed) sources and databases generated by U.S. and Brazilian governments, as well as international organizations, and press articles. RESULTS: This perspective review lists recommendations for researchers, health providers, and policymakers to promote greater inclusion of U.S. Brazilian populations in health research and care. The review identifies research areas in need of attention to address health inequities and promote mental/brain health in Brazilian immigrants and their offspring living in the U.S. These research areas are: 1) epidemiological studies to map the prevalence and incidence of mental/brain health conditions; 2) research on aging and AD/ADRD risk factors among Brazilian populations in the U.S.; and 3) the need for greater representation of U.S-residing Brazilian population in other relevant research areas involving genetics, neuropathology, and clinical trials. CONCLUSIONS: The recommendation and research efforts proposed should help to pave the way for the development of community-engagement research and to promote mental/brain health education, improvement of mental/brain health and AD/ADRD services, and the development of culturally-informed intervention to the U.S.-residing Brazilian communities. HIGHLIGHTS: The Brazilian population in the United States is growing but is underrepresented in U.S. health research.Approximately 71% of Brazilian immigrants in the United States are undocumented, with an increased risk for health inequities.Mental health is reported as a central health priority by Brazilian immigrants in the United States.There is a lack of research on Alzheimer's disease and other dementias (ADRD) in Brazilian immigrants in the United States.Epidemiological research is needed to map the prevalence/incidence of mental health conditions and ADRD risk factors among Brazilian immigrants in the United States.

Evaluating genomic signatures of aging in brain tissue as it relates to Alzheimer's disease.	Telomere length (TL) attrition, epigenetic age acceleration, and mitochondrial DNA copy number (mtDNAcn) decline are established hallmarks of aging. Each has been individually associated with Alzheimer's dementia, cognitive function, and pathologic Alzheimer's disease (AD). Epigenetic age and mtDNAcn have been studied in brain tissue directly but prior work on TL in brain is limited to small sample sizes and most studies have examined leukocyte TL. Importantly, TL, epigenetic age clocks, and mtDNAcn have not been studied jointly in brain tissue from an AD cohort. We examined dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) tissue from N = 367 participants of the Religious Orders Study (ROS) or the Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP). TL and mtDNAcn were estimated from whole genome sequencing (WGS) data and cortical clock age was computed on 347 CpG sites. We examined dementia, MCI, and level of and change in cognition, pathologic AD, and three quantitative AD traits, as well as measures of other neurodegenerative diseases and cerebrovascular diseases (CVD). We previously showed that mtDNAcn from DLPFC brain tissue was associated with clinical and pathologic features of AD. Here, we show that those associations are independent of TL. We found TL to be associated with β-amyloid levels (beta = - 0.15, p = 0.023), hippocampal sclerosis (OR = 0.56, p = 0.0015) and cerebral atherosclerosis (OR = 1.44, p = 0.0007). We found strong associations between mtDNAcn and clinical measures of AD. The strongest associations with pathologic measures of AD were with cortical clock and there were associations of mtDNAcn with global AD pathology and tau tangles. Of the other pathologic traits, mtDNAcn was associated with hippocampal sclerosis, macroscopic infarctions and CAA and cortical clock was associated with Lewy bodies. Multi-modal age acceleration, accelerated aging on both mtDNAcn and cortical clock, had greater effect size than a single measure alone. These findings highlight for the first time that age acceleration determined on multiple genomic measures, mtDNAcn and cortical clock may have a larger effect on AD/AD related disorders (ADRD) pathogenesis than single measures.

Amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques from Alzheimer's Disease (AD) can be visualized ex vivo in label-free brain samples using synchrotron X-ray phase-contrast tomography (XPCT). However, for XPCT to be useful as a screening method for amyloid pathology, it is essential to understand which factors drive the detection of Aβ plaques. The current study was designed to test the hypothesis that Aβ-related contrast in XPCT could be caused by Aβ fibrils and/or by metals trapped in the plaques. Fibrillar and elemental compositions of Aβ plaques were probed in brain samples from different types of AD patients and AD models to establish a relationship between XPCT contrast and Aβ plaque characteristics. XPCT, micro-Fourier-Transform Infrared spectroscopy and micro-X-Ray Fluorescence spectroscopy were conducted on human samples (one genetic and one sporadic case) and on four transgenic rodent strains (mouse: APPPS1, ArcAβ, J20; rat: TgF344). Aβ plaques from the genetic AD patient were visible using XPCT, and had higher β-sheet content and higher metal levels than those from the sporadic AD patient, which remained undetected by XPCT. Aβ plaques in J20 mice and TgF344 rats appeared hyperdense on XPCT images, while they were hypodense with a hyperdense core in the case of APPPS1 and ArcAβ mice. In all four transgenic strains, β-sheet content was similar, while metal levels were highly variable: J20 (zinc and iron) and TgF344 (copper) strains showed greater metal accumulation than APPPS1 and ArcAβ mice. Hence, a hyperdense contrast formation of Aβ plaques in XPCT images was associated with biometal entrapment within plaques. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: The role of metals in Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been a subject of continuous interest. It was already known that amyloid-β plaques (Aβ), the earliest hallmark of AD, tend to trap endogenous biometals like zinc, iron and copper. Here we show that this metal accumulation is the main reason why Aβ plaques are detected with a new technique called X-ray phase contrast tomography (XPCT). XPCT enables to map the distribution of Aβ plaques in the whole excised brain without labeling. In this work we describe a unique collection of four transgenic models of AD, together with a human sporadic and a rare genetic case of AD, thus exploring the full spectrum of amyloid contrast in XPCT.

A data-driven study of Alzheimer's disease related amyloid and tau pathology progression.	Amyloid-β is thought to facilitate the spread of tau throughout the neocortex in Alzheimer's disease, though how this occurs is not well understood. This is because of the spatial discordance between amyloid-β, which accumulates in the neocortex, and tau, which accumulates in the medial temporal lobe during ageing. There is evidence that in some cases amyloid-β-independent tau spreads beyond the medial temporal lobe where it may interact with neocortical amyloid-β. This suggests that there may be multiple distinct spatiotemporal subtypes of Alzheimer's-related protein aggregation, with potentially different demographic and genetic risk profiles. We investigated this hypothesis, applying data-driven disease progression subtyping models to post-mortem neuropathology and in vivo PET-based measures from two large observational studies: the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and the Religious Orders Study and Rush Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP). We consistently identified 'amyloid-first' and 'tau-first' subtypes using cross-sectional information from both studies. In the amyloid-first subtype, extensive neocortical amyloid-β precedes the spread of tau beyond the medial temporal lobe, while in the tau-first subtype, mild tau accumulates in medial temporal and neocortical areas prior to interacting with amyloid-β. As expected, we found a higher prevalence of the amyloid-first subtype among apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 allele carriers while the tau-first subtype was more common among APOE ε4 non-carriers. Within tau-first APOE ε4 carriers, we found an increased rate of amyloid-β accumulation (via longitudinal amyloid PET), suggesting that this rare group may belong within the Alzheimer's disease continuum. We also found that tau-first APOE ε4 carriers had several fewer years of education than other groups, suggesting a role for modifiable risk factors in facilitating amyloid-β-independent tau. Tau-first APOE ε4 non-carriers, in contrast, recapitulated many of the features of primary age-related tauopathy. The rate of longitudinal amyloid-β and tau accumulation (both measured via PET) within this group did not differ from normal ageing, supporting the distinction of primary age-related tauopathy from Alzheimer's disease. We also found reduced longitudinal subtype consistency within tau-first APOE ε4 non-carriers, suggesting additional heterogeneity within this group. Our findings support the idea that amyloid-β and tau may begin as independent processes in spatially disconnected regions, with widespread neocortical tau resulting from the local interaction of amyloid-β and tau. The site of this interaction may be subtype-dependent: medial temporal lobe in amyloid-first, neocortex in tau-first. These insights into the dynamics of amyloid-β and tau may inform research and clinical trials that target these pathologies.

Identifying novel mechanisms underlying dementia is critical to improving prevention and treatment. As an approach to mechanistic discovery, we investigated whether MIND diet (Mediterranean-DASH Diet Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay), a consistent risk factor for dementia, is correlated with a specific profile of cortical gene expression, and whether such a transcriptomic profile is associated with dementia, in the Religious Orders Study (ROS) and Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP). RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) was conducted in postmortem dorsolateral prefrontal cortex tissue from 1,204 deceased participants; neuropsychological assessments were performed annually prior to death. In a subset of 482 participants, diet was assessed ~6 years before death using a validated food-frequency questionnaire; in these participants, using elastic net regression, we identified a transcriptomic profile, consisting of 50 genes, significantly correlated with MIND diet score (

Genome-Wide Mapping Implicates 5-Hydroxymethylcytosines in Diabetes Mellitus and Alzheimer's Disease.	BACKGROUND: Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a recognized risk factor for dementia. Because DM is a potentially modifiable condition, greater understanding of the mechanisms linking DM to the clinical expression of Alzheimer's disease dementia may provide insights into much needed dementia therapeutics. OBJECTIVE: In this feasibility study, we investigated DM as a dementia risk factor by examining genome-wide distributions of the epigenetic DNA modification 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC). METHODS: We obtained biologic samples from the Rush Memory and Aging Project and used the highly sensitive 5hmC-Seal technique to perform genome-wide profiling of 5hmC in circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) from antemortem serum samples and in genomic DNA from postmortem prefrontal cortex brain tissue from 80 individuals across four groups: Alzheimer's disease neuropathologically defined (AD), DM clinically defined, AD with DM, and individuals with neither disease (controls). RESULTS: Distinct 5hmC signatures and biological pathways were enriched in persons with both AD and DM versus AD alone, DM alone, or controls, including genes inhibited by EGFR signaling in oligodendroglia and those activated by constitutive RHOA. We also demonstrate the potential diagnostic value of 5hmC profiling in circulating cfDNA. Specifically, an 11-gene weighted model distinguished AD from non-AD/non-DM controls (AUC = 91.8%; 95% CI, 82.9-100.0%), while a 4-gene model distinguished DM-associated AD from AD alone (AUC = 87.9%; 95% CI, 77.5-98.3%). CONCLUSION: We demonstrate in this small sample, the feasibility of detecting and characterizing 5hmC in DM-associated AD and of using 5hmC information contained in circulating cfDNA to detect AD in high-risk individuals, such as those with diabetes.	5-hydroxymethylcytosine; Alzheimer’s disease; cell-free DNA; dementia; diabetes mellitus; epigenetics

Multi-site video-based assessment with the NACC UDS-Version 3 battery: Design and participant experience in the V-Cog study.	INTRODUCTION: Video-based cognitive testing is becoming more common. The 'VCog' study aims to evaluate the validity, feasibility, and acceptability of a standardized video-administered cognitive research battery. METHODS: Twelve Alzheimer's Disease Research Centers (ADRCs) administered, in randomized order, an in-person and video-adapted Uniform Data Set Version 3 (UDSv3) cognitive assessment battery to participants with normal cognition (n = 156), mild cognitive impairment (MCI; n = 230), and dementia (n = 77). Acceptability of technology and participant experience completing video testing was assessed. RESULTS: Of 463 participants (mean age 75.1 years, 52.5% female, and 25.5% non-White individuals), most rated video testing as easy (90.0%), convenient (95.3%) and would accept it in future visits (75.5%). Greater cognitive impairment was associated with more difficulty with setup and use of video. Staff rated most administrations as producing valid data (94.8%). DISCUSSION: Video-based research cognitive testing with an adapted UDSv3 battery is feasible and well-accepted among older adults with and without cognitive impairment. HIGHLIGHTS: The COVID-19 pandemic increased the need for video-administered cognitive assessments in Alzheimer's Disease Research Centers (ADRCs) . Feasibility, acceptability, and validity of video cognitive testing were evaluated. Participant experience and examiner evaluations of data validity were positive. Video assessment may extend the ADRCs reach to otherwise unreachable participants.

Genetic association analyses of cognitive performance across multi-ancestry older adults: Application of Tobit models.	BackgroundPrevious studies investigating associations between genetic variants and late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD)-related cognitive functions included primarily European-ancestry individuals and utilized linear models on neuropsychological test scores with ceiling effects.ObjectiveInvestigate associations between LOAD-related single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and neuropsychological test scores by applying the superior approach, Tobit (versus linear) regression models, to identify population-specific SNPs associated with cognitive performance across multiple genetic ancestry groups.MethodsNational Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC) Uniform Data Set (UDS) and Alzheimer's Disease Genetics Consortium (ADGC) provided phenotype and genotype data on Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (ADRC) participants, respectively. Using the ADGC genotype data, genetic ancestry groups were identified for ADRC participants, including non-Hispanic White (NHW), African American (AA), Hispanic, and Asian. Tobit and linear models were applied to examine genetic associations of 84 LOAD-related SNPs with cognitive performance at the most recent visit, utilizing the NACC UDS data.ResultsGenetic architectures varied across genetic ancestry groups.

Classification of AD and bvFTD using neuropsychological and neuropsychiatric variables: a machine learning study.	INTRODUCTION: Machine learning (ML) is increasingly used for clinical classification of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias. Prior studies identified useful diagnostic features for AD and behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), though they often lack pathological verification. We applied ML to classify AD and bvFTD autopsy status using initial visit neuropsychological and neuropsychiatric data. METHODS: Data from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center Uniform Data Set and Neuropathology Data Set were analyzed using logistic regression, support vector machines, random forest, and artificial neural networks to classify autopsy-confirmed diagnosis based on symptom and cognitive data. RESULTS: Among 1616 participants (AD = 1498, bvFTD = 118), all algorithms achieved high accuracy (80% to 90%) and discriminatory ability (AUC = 0.89 to 0.95). Apathy, disinhibition, and digit-symbol substitution were the most important classification features. DISCUSSION: Findings emphasize the value of specific clinical disease markers to support differential diagnosis of AD and bvFTD. HIGHLIGHTS: Four ML algorithms were used for the classification of AD and bvFTD. Neuropsychological subtests and neuropsychiatric symptoms were input features. Models had high classification accuracy and discrimination. We identified important and accessible clinical features for classification.

Brain Structures Associated with Depression in Older Adults in the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center Uniform Data Set.	PurposeThis study examined relations between four late-life depression subgroups (recent, >2 years ago, chronic, no depression) and regional brain volumes using structural MRI data from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (n=1,551).Data AnalysisMultiple linear regressions evaluated the effects of depression on 30 MRI biomarkers, while moderation analyses assessed how APOE ε4 and depression shape the connections between cognitive status and brain structure volumes.ResultsAfter adjusting for covariates and applying Hochberg's method, recent depression (< 2 years) was associated with reduced total cerebrum cranial volume and left frontal lobe cortical gray matter volume. Chronic depression correlated with larger right lateral ventricle volume.ConclusionThese findings suggest that recent depression is linked to brain atrophy across specific regions and ventricular enlargement. Future research should investigate age-related impacts on these associations and whether restoration of brain volume occurs after depressive symptoms subside.

BACKGROUND: Amyloid beta (Aβ) targeting immunotherapies have evolved as promising treatment options for patients with early symptomatic Alzheimer's disease (AD). Understanding how eligibilty criteria impact on the number of patients potentially qualifying for treatment is of high relevance for designing diagnostic workflows in clinical practice and for estimating required ressources and costs. OBJECTIVES: We aimed at estimating the number of potentially eligible patients for treatment with the Aβ targeting antibodies aducanumab, lecanemab and donanemab in a specialized center real-world sample by the applying the phase 3 clinical trial and the appropriate use recommendations (AUR) inclusion and exclusion criteria to the data set. The post-mortem report was used for defining amyloid positivity and the presence of AD pathology in this study. DESIGN: Retrospective, descriptive study. SETTING: The multicenter National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center-Uniform Data Set (NACC-UDS) and Neuropathology Data Set (NACCNP). PARTICIPANTS: We included all 3,343 participants of the NACC dataset with available post-mortem pathology reports. MEASUREMENTS/RESULTS: 887 participants were potential candidates for anti-Aβ immunotherapy as they presented with amnestic mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia and the clinical diagnosis of AD (amnestic AD syndrome). Applying the criterion of amyloid positivity (post mortem report) and the clinical trial inclusion and exclusion criteria to this sample resulted in 83 (9 %), 275 (31 %), and 172 (19 %) participants eligible for treatment with aducanumab, lecanemab, and donanemab, respectively. Applying the criteria of the AUR resulted in 242 (27 %) and 266 (30 %) participants eligible for treatment with aducanumab or lecanemab, respectively. The eligible participant groups for each antibody showed partial, but not full overlap. Co-pathologies were common. CONCLUSIONS: The number of eligible participants varies between the different antibodies and the selected groups only partly overlap, indicating partly different groups of eligible participants for each antibody. Since not all inclusion and exclusion criteria can be extracted from the NACC-UDS dataset, the real number of eligible patients will be smaller.

Referral Sources Across Racial and Ethnic Groups at Alzheimer's Disease Research Centers.	BACKGROUND: Despite the need to increase engagement of underrepresented groups (URG) in Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) studies, enrollment remains low. OBJECTIVE: Compare referral sources across racial and ethnic groups among participants enrolled in ADRC studies. METHODS: Data for this cross-sectional secondary analysis were extracted from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center Uniform Data Set. We performed mixed effects logistic regression models using generalized estimating equations for professional referral versus non-professional referral by racial and ethnic group, adjusted for age, gender, education, visit year, and Clinical Dementia Rating scale (CDR) with a random effect for study site. RESULTS: Included in the analysis were 48,330 participants across 46 ADRCs (mean [SD] age, 71.3 [10.5] years; 20,767 female [57%]; 4,138 Hispanic [8.6%]; 1,392 non-Hispanic Asian [2.9%]; 6,766 non-Hispanic Black [14%] individuals; and 676 individuals [1.4%] of other races. Non-Hispanic Black and Asian participants had lower odds of being referred by a professional contact compared to non-Hispanic White participants (Black: adjusted OR = 0.61, 95% CI = 0.44-0.86, p = 0.005; Asian: adjusted OR = 0.65, 95% CI, p = 0.004). In participants who had completed an MRI, there was no significant difference in referral source across ethnic and racial groups. CONCLUSIONS: Further studies are needed to better understand the systemic and structural factors that contribute to differences in referral sources and disparities in recruitment of URG into ADRD studies.

Associations of cerebrovascular disease and Alzheimer's disease pathology with cognitive decline: Analysis of the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center Uniform Data Set.	Cerebrovascular disease (CVD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) often co-occur and may impact specific cognitive domains. This study's goal was to determine effects of CVD and AD burden on cross-sectional and longitudinal executive function (EF) and memory in older adults. Longitudinally followed participants from the National Alzheimer Coordinating Center database (n = 3342) were included. Cognitive outcomes were EF and memory composite scores. Baseline CVD presence was defined by moderate-to-severe white matter hyperintensities or lacunar infarct on MRI. Baseline AD pathology was defined by amyloid positivity via PET or CSF. Linear mixed models examined effects of CVD, AD, and time on cognitive outcomes, controlling for sex, education, baseline age, MoCA score, and total number of study visits. At baseline, CVD associated with lower EF (p < 0.001), while AD associated with lower EF and memory (ps < 0.001). Longitudinally only AD associated with faster declines in memory and EF (ps < 0.001). These results extend our understanding of CVD and AD pathology, highlighting that CVD does not necessarily indicate accelerated decline.

Genome-wide association studies of TDP-43 proteinopathy and hippocampal sclerosis reveal shared genetic associations with APOE and TMEM106B.	INTRODUCTION: Transactive response DNA binding protein 43 kDa (TDP-43) proteinopathy has been linked to cognitive decline and often co-occurs with hippocampal sclerosis (HS). To identify genetic markers of TDP-43 proteinopathy and HS, we performed genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of HS and TDP-43 inclusions. METHODS: Genetic data were obtained through the Alzheimer Disease Genetics Consortium and collaborating sites (HS: N = 9509; TDP-43: N = 4669). Statistical analyses included association analysis with HS and TDP-43 inclusions and meta-analysis, a mediation analysis, and fine mapping of the transmembrane protein 106B (TMEM106B) region. RESULTS: Two regions achieved genome-wide significance with TDP-43: apolipoprotein E (APOE) and TMEM106B. Three loci reached genome-wide significance with HS: APOE, TMEM106B, and granulin precursor (GRN). Fine mapping of TMEM106B identified 93 variants in the credible set. Mediation analyses showed that genetic effects on HS were partially mediated through TDP-43 proteinopathy. DISCUSSION: We identified associations with TDP-43 inclusion and HS, showing shared genetic risk across frontotemporal lobar degeneration, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, and limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy. HIGHLIGHTS: HS and TDP-43 contribute to dementia and often co-occur. The etiology and relationship of HS and TDP-43 remains unclear.

Combining plasma neurofilament light chain and frontotemporal atrophy improves differentiation of bvFTD from primary psychiatric disorders.	INTRODUCTION: Distinguishing behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) from primary psychiatric disorders (PPDs) remains challenging due to overlapping clinical presentation. Neurofilament light chain (NfL) is a biomarker of neuronal damage that is elevated in neurodegenerative diseases. This study assessed the effectiveness of NfL and atrophy in differentiating bvFTD from PPDs. METHODS: Atrophy maps from frontotemporal regions were generated for 55 patients with autopsy-confirmed frontotemporal lobar degeneration (bvFTD-FTLD), 24 mood disorder patients, and eight bvFTD patients later determined to be non-neurodegenerative (bvFTD-nonND). Logistic regression was employed to assess the discriminatory abilities of atrophy and NfL levels between bvFTD-FTLD and PPD (Mood Disorders + bvFTD-nonND). RESULTS: Both atrophy (AUC = 0.87, 95% confidence interval [95% CI: 0.79 to 0.94]) and NfL (AUC = 0.89, 95% CI: 0.81 to 0.96) showed significant predictive ability, which improved when combined (AUC = 0.93, 95% CI: 0.87 to 0.99). Misclassification occurred mostly in low atrophy pathological subtypes and PPD with borderline NfL and frontotemporal volume. CONCLUSION: Combining NfL with atrophy enhances differentiation, but additional markers are needed. HIGHLIGHTS: Atrophy and NfL had comparable effectiveness in differentiating bvFTD from PPD. Combining NfL and frontotemporal atrophy significantly improved predictive accuracy. NfL, in addition to atrophy, may be beneficial in screening for neurodegeneration in ambiguous cases.	behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia; biological markers; frontotemporal dementia; frontotemporal lobar degeneration; neurofilament light chain; neuroimaging; primary psychiatric disorders

Alzheimer's disease diagnostic progression is associated with cerebrovascular disease and neuroinflammation in adults with Down syndrome.	INTRODUCTION: Despite having few vascular risk factors, people with Down syndrome (DS) have MRI evidence of cerebrovascular disease (CVD) and neuroinflammation that worsens with Alzheimer's disease (AD) severity. We investigated whether markers of CVD and inflammation are associated with AD-related diagnostic progression in people with DS. METHODS: We included 149 participants (mean age [SD] = 44.6 [9]) from the Alzheimer's Biomarkers Consortium-Down Syndrome who had two (n = 24) or three follow-up visits (n = 125). We derived white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volume and plasma biomarker (glial fibrillary acidic protein [GFAP], amyloid beta [Aβ]42/Aβ40, hyperphosphorylated tau-217 [p-tau217], and neurofilament light [NfL]) concentrations at baseline and examined their association with progression in clinical diagnosis. RESULTS: Higher baseline WMH volume and higher GFAP were associated with a greater likelihood of diagnostic progression. Combining WMH and GFAP with p-tau217 improved clinical conversion classification accuracy over AD biomarkers alone. Among individuals with evidence of amyloidosis, both WMH and GFAP were associated with clinical progression. DISCUSSION: In DS, markers of CVD and inflammation are independently and synergistically associated with clinical AD progression. HIGHLIGHTS: Higher baseline white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volume and plasma glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) concentration were associated with a higher likelihood of progressing from cognitively stable to either mild cognitive impairment or clinical Alzheimer's disease in Down syndrome. WMH volume and GFAP concentration discriminated between those who progressed and those who did not. Models including the independent and interactive effects of WMH and GFAP more accurately discriminated between participants who progressed diagnostically from those who did not. Individuals with evidence of amyloid pathology were more likely to progress if they also had elevated WMH or GFAP.	Alzheimer's disease progression; biomarker; dementia; white matter hyperintensity

NCRAD: Advancing Alzheimer's research through high-quality biospecimens and data.	The National Centralized Repository for Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (NCRAD) was established in 2002 to support research on the genetics of Alzheimer's disease. NCRAD quickly became a central resource, banking samples from numerous studies and distributing them to researchers worldwide. As genetic risk variants were identified, NCRAD prepared for functional studies by expanding its collections to include peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), RNA, and biofluids. Over the past decade, NCRAD's extensive repository of plasma, serum, and cerebrospinal fluid was essential to the development of fluid biomarkers. NCRAD's rigorous best practices for sample collection, processing, and distribution ensure biospecimens are of the highest quality for a broad range of experimental approaches. Currently, NCRAD banks samples from 91 studies representing over 135,000 unique, well-characterized participants, and has distributed over 440,000 aliquots to more than 300 researchers. Data from NCRAD-supported studies have contributed to over 1100 publications and numerous key discoveries in Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) genetics and biomarkers. HIGHLIGHTS: Centralized Biobanking for ADRD Research: National Centralized Repository for Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (NCRAD) supports over 90 National Institute on Aging (NIA) -funded studies by providing standardized, high-quality biospecimens and longitudinal sample collections, enabling reproducible and scalable research into Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD). Enabling Genetic Discovery and Functional Genomics: NCRAD partnerships with numerous research initiatives has facilitated major advances in gene discovery, while also supporting downstream functional studies using induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), transcriptomics, and post mortem brain tissue. Rigorous QA/QC and Automation Infrastructure: NCRAD employs comprehensive quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC) systems and cutting-edge automation-including robotic liquid handling, automated nucleic acid extraction, and ultra-low temperature storage-to ensure biospecimen integrity and reduce preanalytical variability. Unique Sample Distribution and Data Sharing Model: NCRAD's blinded sample distribution system and emphasis on returning data to public repositories ensure broad research access, maximize scientific output, and promote transparency and reproducibility. Collaborative, Scalable Repository Ecosystem: As part of Indiana University's integrated biobanking infrastructure, NCRAD supports efficient cross-study and cross-repository research, enabling large-scale multi-omic and biomarker analyses across diverse neurodegenerative diseases.

Evaluation of plasma p-tau217 for detecting amyloid pathology in a heterogeneous community-based cohort.	INTRODUCTION: Studies suggest excellent performance of plasma phosphorylated tau 217 (p-tau217) for detecting amyloid pathology, though studies in more representative populations are needed to validate previously determined cutpoints. METHODS: Plasma p-tau217 utility for detecting amyloid pathology (Aβ) via amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) was assessed in a heterogeneous, community-based cohort in the Wake Forest Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (WFADRC). Participants with baseline plasma data (n = 598) were 21% Black; 313 cognitive unimpaired (CU), 214 mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 64 dementia (DEM); 49% prediabetic, 44% hypertensive, 29% overweight/obese; and 64% had mild-to-moderate kidney disease. Gaussian-mixture models, logistic regression, and receiver operating curve analyses were performed. RESULTS: Plasma p-tau217 was associated with elevated Aβ deposition and accurately classified Aβ-positive participants (PET [n = 307]: area under the curve [AUC] = 94%-97%, cutpoint ≥ 0.338 pg/mL). DISCUSSION: Plasma p-tau217 is an accurate indicator of amyloid pathology in a heterogeneous cohort and is superior to other plasma biomarkers assessed. HIGHLIGHTS: The Wake Forest Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (WFADRC) is a heterogeneous cohort. p-tau217 levels were lower, on average, in cognitively unimpaired participants, females, and Black participants. Plasma p-tau217 classified amyloid positron emission tomography (PET)-positive individuals with high precision and performed better than p-tau181. Cutpoints and reference ranges of plasma p-tau217 were lower compared to recently published thresholds. Combining cutpoint approaches, a four-tier system captured cohort heterogeneity.

Targeting of phosphorylated tau at threonine 181 by a Qβ virus-like particle vaccine is safe, highly immunogenic, and reduces disease severity in mice and rhesus macaques.	"INTRODUCTION: Pathological accumulation of tau (pTau) contributes to various tauopathies, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), and correlates with cognitive decline. A rapid surge in tau-targeted approaches via anti-sense oligonucleotides, active/passive immunotherapies suggests that targeting p-Tau is a viable strategy against tauopathies. METHOD: We describe a multi-species validation of our previously described Qß virus-like particle (VLP)-based vaccine technology targeting phosphorylated tau on threonine 181 (pT181-Qß). RESULTS: Two vaccine doses of pT181-Qß, without any adjuvants, elicited robust antibody responses in two different mouse models of tauopathy (PS19 and hTau) and rhesus macaques. In mouse models, vaccination reduced AT180+ hyperphosphorylated, Sarkosyl insoluble, Gallyas silver positive tau, inflammasomes/neuroinflammation, and improved recognition memory and motor function without inducing adverse T-cell activation. Anti-pT181 antibodies are reactive to pTau in human AD brains, engage pT181+ tau in human brain lysates, and are central nervous system bioavailable. DISCUSSION: Our results suggest the translational utility of pT181-Qß against tauopathies. HIGHLIGHTS: Icosahedral display of phosphorylated tau at threonine 181 (pT181) Qß virus-like particle surface (""pT181-Qß"" vaccine) induces a robust immune response in mice and in non-human primates (NHPs) pT181-Qß vaccination reduces pathological tau (pTau) and brain atrophy, and improves memory and motor function in PS19 and hTau mice. pT181-Qß vaccination-induced immunoglobulin Gs (IgGs) are safe, Th2 skewed (anti-inflammatory), specific to pTau in human AD brain, and efficiently engage pT181 in NHPs and human brain lysate. pT181"	Alzheimer's disease; PS19; hTau; immunotherapy; mild cognitive impairment; non‐human primates; pT181; rhesus macaques; tau; tauopathies; vaccines; virus‐like particles

BACKGROUND: Therapeutic development for frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is hindered by the lack of biomarkers that inform susceptibility/risk, prognosis, and the underlying causative pathology. Blood glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) has garnered attention as a FTD biomarker. However, investigations of GFAP in FTD have been hampered by symptomatic and histopathologic heterogeneity and small cohort sizes contributing to inconsistent findings. Therefore, we evaluated plasma GFAP as a FTD biomarker and compared its performance to that of neurofilament light (NfL) protein, a leading FTD biomarker. METHODS: We availed ARTFL LEFFTDS Longitudinal Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration (ALLFTD) study resources to conduct a comprehensive cross-sectional and longitudinal examination of the susceptibility/risk, prognostic, and predictive performance of GFAP and NfL in the largest series of well-characterized presymptomatic FTD mutation carriers and participants with sporadic or familial FTD syndromes. Utilizing single molecule array technology, we measured GFAP and NfL in plasma from 161 controls, 127 presymptomatic mutation carriers, 702 participants with a FTD syndrome, and 67 participants with mild behavioral and/or cognitive changes. We used multivariable linear regression and Cox proportional hazard models adjusted for co-variates to examine the biomarker utility of baseline GFAP and NfL concentrations or their rates of change. RESULTS: Compared to controls, GFAP and NfL were elevated in each FTD syndrome but GFAP, unlike NfL, poorly discriminated controls from participants with mild symptoms. Similarly, both baseline GFAP and NfL were higher in presymptomatic mutation carriers who later phenoconverted, but NfL better distinguished non-converters from phenoconverters. We additionally observed that GFAP and NfL were associated with disease severity indicators and survival, but NfL far outperformed GFAP. Nevertheless, we validated findings that the GFAP/NfL ratio may discriminate frontotemporal lobar degeneration with tau versus TDP-43 pathology. CONCLUSIONS: Our head-to-head comparison of plasma GFAP and NfL as biomarkers for FTD indicate that NfL consistently outmatched GFAP as a prognostic and predictive biomarker for participants with a FTD syndrome, and as a susceptibility/risk biomarker for people at genetic risk of FTD. Our findings underscore the need to include leading biomarkers in investigations evaluating new biomarkers if the field is to fully ascertain their performance and clinical value.

Single-microglia transcriptomic transition network-based prediction and real-world patient data validation identifies ketorolac as a repurposable drug for Alzheimer's disease.	INTRODUCTION: High microglial heterogeneities hinder the development of microglia-targeted treatment for Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHODS: We integrated 0.7 million single-nuclei RNA-sequencing transcriptomes from human brains using a variational autoencoder. We predicted AD-relevant microglial subtype-specific transition networks for disease-associated microglia (DAM), tau microglia, and neuroinflammation-like microglia (NIM). We prioritized drugs by specifically targeting microglia-specific transition networks and validated drugs using two independent real-world patient databases. RESULTS: We identified putative AD molecular drivers (e.g., SYK, CTSB, and INPP5D) in transition networks of DAM and NIM. Via specifically targeting NIM, we identified that usage of ketorolac was associated with reduced AD incidence in both MarketScan (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.89) and INSIGHT (HR = 0.83) Clinical Research Network databases, mechanistically supported by ketorolac-treated transcriptomic data from AD patient induced pluripotent stem cell-derived microglia. DISCUSSION: This study offers insights into the pathobiology of AD-relevant microglial subtypes and identifies ketorolac as a potential anti-inflammatory treatment for AD. HIGHLIGHTS: An integrative analysis of ≈ 0.7 million single-nuclei RNA-sequencing transcriptomes from human brains identified Alzheimer's disease (AD)-relevant microglia subtypes. Network-based analysis identified putative molecular drivers (e.g., SYK, CTSB, INPP5D) of transition networks between disease-associated microglia (DAM) and neuroinflammation-like microglia (NIM). Via network-based prediction and population-based validation, we identified that usage of ketorolac (a US Food and Drug Administration-approved anti-inflammatory medicine) was associated with reduced AD incidence in two independent patient databases. Mechanistic observation showed that ketorolac treatment downregulated the Type-I interferon signaling in patient induced pluripotent stem cell-derived microglia, mechanistically supporting its protective effects in real-world patient databases.

Alzheimer disease-related biomarkers and cancer-related cognitive decline: the Thinking and Living with Cancer study.	PURPOSE: We evaluated whether plasma Alzheimer disease (AD)-related biomarkers were associated with cancer-related cognitive decline among older breast cancer survivors. METHODS: We included survivors aged 60-90 years with primary stage 0-III breast cancers (n = 236) and frequency-matched noncancer control paricipant (n = 154) who passed a cognitive screen and had banked plasma specimens. Participants were assessed at baseline (presystemic therapy) and annually for up to 60 months. Cognition was measured using tests of attention, processing speed, and executive function and learning and memory; perceived cognition was measured by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Cognitive Function v3 Perceived Cognitive Impairments. Baseline plasma neurofilament light, glial fibrillary acidic protein, β-amyloid 42 and 40 and phosphorylated tau 181 were assayed using single molecule arrays. Mixed models tested associations between cognition and baseline AD biomarkers, time, group (survivor vs control participant), and their 2- and 3-way interactions, controlling for age, race, Wide Range 4 Achievement Test Word Reading score, comorbidity, and body mass index; 2-sided P values of .05 were considered statistically significant. RESULTS: There were no group differences in baseline AD-related biomarkers except survivors had higher baseline neurofilament light levels than control participants (P = .013). Survivors had lower adjusted longitudinal attention, processing speed, and executive function than control participants starting from baseline and continuing over time (P ≤ .002). However, baseline AD-related biomarker levels were not independently associated with adjusted cognition over time, except control participants had lower attention, processing speed, and executive function scores with higher glial fibrillary acidic protein levels (P = .008). CONCLUSION: The results do not support a relationship between baseline AD-related biomarkers and cancer-related cognitive decline. Further investigation is warranted to confirm the findings, test effects of longitudinal changes in AD-related biomarkers, and examine other mechanisms and factors affecting cognition presystemic therapy.

The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative in the era of Alzheimer's disease treatment: A review of ADNI studies from 2021 to 2022.	The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) aims to improve Alzheimer's disease (AD) clinical trials. Since 2006, ADNI has shared clinical, neuroimaging, and cognitive data, and biofluid samples. We used conventional search methods to identify 1459 publications from 2021 to 2022 using ADNI data/samples and reviewed 291 impactful studies. This review details how ADNI studies improved disease progression understanding and clinical trial efficiency. Advances in subject selection, detection of treatment effects, harmonization, and modeling improved clinical trials and plasma biomarkers like phosphorylated tau showed promise for clinical use. Biomarkers of amyloid beta, tau, neurodegeneration, inflammation, and others were prognostic with individualized prediction algorithms available online. Studies supported the amyloid cascade, emphasized the importance of neuroinflammation, and detailed widespread heterogeneity in disease, linked to genetic and vascular risk, co-pathologies, sex, and resilience. Biological subtypes were consistently observed. Generalizability of ADNI results is limited by lack of cohort diversity, an issue ADNI-4 aims to address by enrolling a diverse cohort.

Dissecting real-world memory clinical cohort heterogeneity: analysis of neuroanatomical subtypes using HYDRA.	BACKGROUND: There is significant evidence for neuroanatomical heterogeneity in neurodegenerative disorders, which has been demonstrated predominantly through analyses of well-characterized research cohorts. Despite the known diversity in clinical presentations among patients attending memory clinics, studies exploring neuroanatomical heterogeneity in such clinically diverse groups remain sparse. METHODS: To address this gap, we applied the semi-supervised Heterogeneity through Discriminative Analysis (HYDRA) (Neuroimage 145:346-364 2017) machine learning method to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data from the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS) (NeuroImage 26:102248 2020) to uncover patterns of neurostructural heterogeneity in memory clinic attendees. Cross-validation was used to assess clustering stability via the Adjusted Rand Index (ARI), Silhouette Score, and Calinski-Harabasz Index (CHI). We performed survival analyses using Kaplan-Meier curves and mixed-effects models for longitudinal cognitive data (e.g., memory, executive function, and language assessments) to examine differences in disease progression. RESULTS: Cross-validation analyses indicated two highly stable subtypes of cognitively impaired individuals (ARI = 0.552), exhibiting significant neuroanatomical differences. Subtype 1, termed the Temporal-Sparing Atrophy (TSA) Subtype, was defined by relatively mild atrophy, especially in temporal areas, with slower cognitive decline and preserved Function across most domains. Subtype 2, termed the Temporal-Parietal Predominated Atrophy (TPPA) Subtype, was marked by notable alterations in areas critically affected in neurodegenerative disorders. These included key areas critical for executive function and memory, such as the frontal, temporal, and parietal cortices including the precuneus. Longitudinal analysis of neuroimaging and cognitive data revealed contrasting trajectories. The TSA Subtype demonstrated a gradual decline in cognitive functions over time, particularly in the assessments that are memory-focused tests. Conversely, the TPPA Subtype exhibited a more severe decline in these functions. CONCLUSIONS: This research illustrates that neurodegenerative diseases present a spectrum of structural brain changes rather than uniform pathology, suggesting that future research may benefit from stratified therapeutic approaches and targeted recruitment strategies for clinical trials. By leveraging detailed clinical assessments and longitudinal data, including uncertain diagnoses and Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scores, this study contributes to better understanding/characterizing memory clinic populations, which could help with optimizing interventions.

Identification of functional white matter networks in BOLD fMRI.	White matter signals in resting state blood oxygen level dependent functional magnetic resonance (BOLD-fMRI) have been largely discounted, yet there is growing evidence that these signals are indicative of brain activity. Understanding how these white matter signals capture function can provide insight into brain physiology. Moreover, functional signals could potentially be used as early markers for neurological changes, such as in Alzheimer's Disease. To investigate white matter brain networks, we leveraged the OASIS-3 dataset to extract white matter signals from resting state BOLD-FMRI data on 711 subjects. The imaging was longitudinal with a total of 2,026 images. Hierarchical clustering was performed to investigate clusters of voxel-level correlations on the timeseries data. The stability of clusters was measured with the average Dice coefficients on two different cross fold validations. The first validated the stability between scans, and the second validated the stability between populations. Functional clusters at hierarchical levels 4, 9, 13, 18, and 24 had local maximum stability, suggesting better clustered white matter. In comparison with JHU-DTI-SS Type-I Atlas defined regions, clusters at lower hierarchical levels identified well-defined anatomical lobes. At higher hierarchical levels, functional clusters mapped motor and memory functional regions, identifying 50.00%, 20.00%, 27.27%, and 35.14% of the frontal, occipital, parietal, and temporal lobe regions respectively.

Decreased SNCA expression in whole-blood RNA analysis of Parkinson's disease adjusting for neutrophils.	Blood-based RNA transcriptomics offers a promising avenue for identifying biomarkers of Parkinson's disease (PD) progression and mechanisms of pathogenesis. Previous work uncovered an age-related increase of neutrophil-enriched gene expression in PD whole blood, which may obscure disease-relevant transcriptomic signals. To better capture PD-associated molecular differences, we analyzed PD whole-blood RNA sequencing data using a differential expression approach that accounts for neutrophil composition. We built a model to estimate neutrophil percentages in 6897 Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative and Parkinson's Disease Biomarkers Program samples from gene expression. By incorporating predicted neutrophil percentages as a covariate, we see significant SNCA downregulation in all PD cohorts, a signal previously obscured by immune cell-related effects. Lowered SNCA expression was observed in individuals with known PD-linked gene mutations (e.g., SNCA, GBA1, LRRK2) and those without known pathogenic variants. These findings suggest that decreased SNCA expression in whole blood may be a defining transcriptomic feature of PD.

Multi-omics machine learning classifier and blood transcriptomic signature of Parkinson's disease.	Early diagnosis and biomarker discovery to bolster the therapeutic pipeline for Parkinson's disease (PD) are urgently needed. In this study, we leverage the large-scale, whole-blood total RNA and DNA sequencing data from the Accelerating Medicines Partnership in Parkinson's Disease (AMP PD) program to identify PD-associated RNAs, including both known genes and novel circular RNAs (circRNA) and enhancer RNAs (eRNAs). Initially, 874 known genes, 783 eRNAs, and 35 circRNAs were found differentially expressed in PD blood in the PPMI cohort (FDR < 0.05). Based on these findings, a novel multi-omics machine learning model was built to predict PD diagnosis with high performance (AUC = 0.89), which was superior to previous models. We further replicated this discovery in an independent PDBP/BioFIND cohort and confirmed 1,111 significant marker genes, including 491 known genes, 599 eRNAs, and 21 circRNAs. Functional enrichment analysis showed that the PD-associated genes are involved in neutrophil activation and degranulation, as well as the TNF-α signaling pathway. By comparing the PD-associated genes in blood with those in human brain dopamine neurons in our BRAINcode cohort, we found only 44 genes (9% of the known genes) showing significant changes with the same direction in both PD brain neurons and PD blood, among which are neuroinflammation-associated genes IKBIP, CXCR2, and NFKBIB. Our findings demonstrated consistently lower SNCA mRNA levels and the increased expression levels of VDR gene in the blood of early-stage PD patients. In summary, this study provides a generally useful computational framework for further biomarker development and early disease prediction. We also delineate a wide spectrum of the known and novel RNAs linked to PD that are detectable in circulating blood cells in a harmonized, large-scale dataset.

Personalized progression modelling and prediction in Parkinson's disease with a novel multi-modal graph approach.	Parkinson's disease (PD) is a complex neurological disorder characterized by dopaminergic neuron degeneration, leading to diverse motor and non-motor impairments. This variability complicates accurate progression modelling and early-stage prediction. Traditional classification methods based on clinical symptoms are often limited by disease heterogeneity. This study introduces an graph-based interpretable personalized progression method, utilizing data from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) and Stroke Parkinson's Disease Biomarker Program (PDBP). Our approach integrates multimodal inter-individual and intra-individual data, including clinical assessments, MRI, and genetic information to make multi-dimension predictions. Validated using the PDBP dataset from 12 to 36 months, our AdaMedGraph method demonstrated strong performance, achieving AUC values of 0.748 and 0.714 for the 12-month Hoehn and Yahr Scale and Movement Disorder Society-Sponsored Revision of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) III on the PPMI test set. Ablation analysis reveals the importance of baseline clinical assessment predictors. This novel framework improves personalized care and offers insights into unique disease trajectories in PD patients.

Decreased SNCA Expression in Whole-Blood RNA Analysis of Parkinson's Disease Adjusting for Lymphocytes.	Blood-based RNA transcriptomics offers a promising avenue for identifying biomarkers of Parkinson's Disease (PD) progression and may provide mechanistic insights into the systemic biological processes underlying its pathogenesis beyond the well-defined neurodegenerative features. Previous studies have indicated an age-dependent increase in neutrophil-enriched gene expression, alongside a reduction in lymphocyte counts, in individuals with PD. These immune cell changes can obscure disease-relevant transcriptomic signals. In this study, we performed differential expression (DE) analysis of whole-blood RNA sequencing data from PD cohorts, incorporating a correction for immune cell-enriched gene expression, particularly neutrophil-related pathways, to improve the resolution of PD-associated molecular changes. Using 1,254 Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) samples with complete blood count (CBC) data, we developed a predictive model to estimate neutrophil percentages in a 6,987 PPMI and Parkinson's Disease Biomarkers Program (PDBP) samples. We mitigated the confounding effects of immune cell-enriched gene expression by integrating predicted neutrophil percentages as a covariate in DE analysis. This approach revealed a consistent and significant downregulation of SNCA across all PD cohorts, a finding previously obscured by immune cell signatures. Lowered SNCA expression was found in individuals with known predisposition genes (e.g., SNCA, GBA, LRRK2) and in non-genetic PD cohorts lacking known pathogenic mutations, suggesting it may represent a key transcriptomic hallmark of the disease.

Inflammatory Blood Biomarkers Are Associated with Long-Term Clinical Disease Severity in Parkinson's Disease.	An altered immune response has been identified as a pathophysiological factor in Parkinson's disease (PD). We aimed to identify blood immunity-associated proteins that discriminate PD from controls and that are associated with long-term disease severity in PD patients. Immune response-derived proteins in blood plasma were measured using Proximity Extension Technology by OLINK in a cohort of PD patients (N = 66) and age-matched healthy controls (N = 52). In a selection of 30 PD patients, we evaluated changes in protein levels 7-10 years after the baseline and assessed correlations with motor and cognitive assessments. Data from the Parkinson's Disease Biomarkers Program (PDBP) cohort and the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) cohort were used for independent validation. PD patients showed an altered immune response compared to controls based on a panel of four proteins (IL-12B, OPG, CXCL11, and CSF-1). The expression levels of five inflammation-associated proteins (CCL23, CCL25, TNFRSF9, TGF-alpha, and VEGFA) increased over time in PD and were partially associated with more severe motor and cognitive symptoms at follow-up. Increased CCL23 levels were associated with cognitive decline and the	CCL23; Parkinson’s disease; TGF-alpha; TNFRSF9; blood biomarkers; disease severity; immune response

MRI structural and functional axial asymmetry in the brain-first versus body-first subtypes of Parkinson's disease.	Parkinson's Disease (PD) with Rapid Eye Movement Sleep Behavior Disorder (RBD) occurred before (body-first) and after (brain-first) motor symptoms may exhibit different MRI features. We aimed to investigate the structural and functional MRI pattern differences between brain-first and body-first subtypes of PD. 23 body-first and 19 brain-first PD patients, along with 20 matched healthy controls (HC) were enrolled and underwent T1-weighted and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) scans in NJ-dataset. We calculated and compared amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) and gray matter volume (GMV) across groups to identify differential brain regions, which were subsequently extracted in PPMI and OASIS3 datasets. These values were combined with clinical data for binary classification machine learning training (with PPMI including 22 body-first and 35 brain-first patients used for feature selection and OASIS3 including 5 body-first and 10 brain-first patients used for external validation) and correlated with clinical scales. The body-first group exhibited higher zALFF values in the parietal lobe and greater GMV in the frontal lobe, while showing lower zALFF and GMV values in the cerebellum and subcortical nuclei (caudate nucleus for zALFF; medulla, hippocampus, amygdala, and olfactory bulb for GMV) than brain-first group. We identified significant axial asymmetry in functional and structural MRI between brain-first and body-first Parkinson's subtypes, characterized by greater gray matter retention and higher spontaneous neural activity in neocortex in the body-first subtype. Furthermore, integrating MRI and clinical scales effectively distinguished between brain-first and body-first subtypes.

Increased free water in the nucleus basalis of Meynert is associated with worse olfaction in idiopathic Parkinson's disease.	BACKGROUND: The association of cholinergic degeneration and olfactory function in Parkinson's disease (PD) is unclear. Using free water imaging, this study aims to investigate the association between the nucleus basalis of Meynert (NBM) degeneration and olfactory function in patients with PD. METHODS: A total of 281 idiopathic patients with PD and 98 healthy controls with diffusion tensor MRI data were included from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) dataset. Olfactory function was assessed by the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT). Free water and volume of the NBM were measured and compared between the two groups. Furthermore, correlation analyses were performed to determine the association between the free water and volume of the NBM and clinical measures in patients with PD. Then, the discriminative power of the free water was evaluated between PD patients with hyposmia and without hyposmia by receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis. RESULTS: Nucleus basalis of Meynert free water showed a trend toward increase in PD patients compared with healthy controls ( CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated that the free water of the NBM was associated with worse olfaction in idiopathic patients with PD. Our study suggests that free water in the NBM has the potential to provide early biomarkers of olfaction dysfunction in idiopathic patients with PD.

Independent Associations of Sleep and Walking with Cognition in Parkinson's Disease: A Perivascular Spaces Analysis.	Perivascular spaces (PVSs) support brain waste clearance and are influenced by sleep. In Parkinson's disease (PD), sleep is often disrupted, and can co-occur with gait dysfunction. This study investigated how sleep disruption, walking difficulties, and cognition relate in PD, considering PVS as a mediator. Our cohort included 348 participants -healthy controls (HC, n=59), prodromal (n=117), and PD patients (n=172)- in the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) study. Insomnia and walking issues were assessed by questionnaire, cognition was measured with the Symbol Digit Modalities (SDM) test, and PVS volume fraction in white matter (WM-PVS) and basal ganglia (BG-PVS) was quantified. PVS did not mediate the relationship between sleep or motor problems, on cognition. Walking difficulties were directly linked to poorer cognition, and insomnia to walking deficits. BG-PVS was negatively associated with cognition. PVS burden predicted cognitive function after five years, but not disease progression as indexed by cerebro-spinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers. These findings suggest walking deficits directly relate with cognition in PD, but the relationship is not mediated by PVS.

Predicting mild cognitive impairment in patients with Parkinson's disease by integrating striatal MRI radiomics with clinical features.	BACKGROUND: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a common and impactful non-motor complication in Parkinson's disease (PD) that often precedes dementia, underscores the urgent need for early predictive tools applicable to routine clinical practice. This study aims to address this issue by investigating whether integrating striatal radiomics features from structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with clinical data can predict MCI in PD patients. METHODS: Baseline T1-weighted MRI images and clinical data of 254 PD patients from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) database were retrospectively analyzed. Cognitive function was assessed using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), with PD patients classified as PD-MCI or cognitively normal (PD-CN). A total of 1,316 radiomics features were extracted from the bilateral caudate nucleus (CN) and putamen (PU). After dimension reduction and feature selection, a radiomics model was constructed. Independent clinical risk factors were identified via univariate and multivariate logistic regression, and further integrated with radiomics features to develop a clinical-radiomics combined model for PD-MCI prediction. Model performance was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), calibration curve, confusion matrix, F1 score, and decision curve analysis (DCA). Correlations between key radiomics features and MoCA scores were also evaluated. RESULTS: Age and years of education (YOE) were identified as independent clinical risk factors for PD-MCI. The clinical-radiomics combined model outperformed the radiomics-only model in both the training and test sets, with the model incorporating the right PU (PUR) radiomics features achieving the highest AUC: 0.852 (95% CI: 0.787-0.918) in the training set and 0.790 (95% CI: 0.657-0.923) in the test set. The corresponding F1 scores were 0.704 and 0.667, respectively. Additionally, specific radiomics features showed weak but significant correlations with MoCA scores (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Integration of striatal radiomics features derived from structural MRI images with routine clinical factors demonstrates promising predictive performance for PD-MCI. The proposed clinical-radiomics combined model leverages clinically accessible resources, and its predictive value for PD-MCI establishes a preliminary foundation for subsequent related explorations. However, the model's generalizability remains unconfirmed, further validation on independent datasets is required before any consideration of its clinical application.

Impact of image preprocessing methods on MRI radiomics feature variability and classification performance in Parkinson's disease motor subtype analysis.	To evaluate the impact of various magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) preprocessing methods on radiomic feature reproducibility and classification performance in differentiating Parkinson's disease (PD) motor subtypes. We analyzed 210 T1-weighted MRI scans from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) database, including 140 PD patients (70 tremor-dominant (TD), 70 postural instability/gait difficulty (PIGD)) and 70 healthy controls. Five preprocessing pipelines were applied, and 22,560 radiomic features were extracted from 16 brain regions. Feature reproducibility was assessed using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC). Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers were developed using all features and only reproducible features to compare classification performance across preprocessing methods. Wavelet-based features showed the highest reproducibility, with 37% demonstrating excellent ICC values (≥ 0.90). Excluding non-reproducible features generally improved classification performance. Specific results include: (1) The Smallest Univalue Segment Assimilating Nucleus (SUSAN) denoising + Bias field correction + Z-score Normalization (S + B + ZN) method achieved the highest Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) Curve (AUC) (0.88) before feature exclusion. (2) After excluding non-reproducible features, the Bias field correction + Z-score Normalization (B + ZN) method showed the most significant improvement, with AUC increasing from 0.49 to 0.64. (3) Texture-based features, particularly from Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) and Gray Level Size Zone Matrix (GLSZM), were among the most reproducible across preprocessing methods. MRI preprocessing methods significantly impact radiomic feature reproducibility and subsequent classification performance in PD motor subtype analysis. Wavelet-based and texture features demonstrated high reproducibility, while excluding non-reproducible features generally improved classification accuracy. These findings underscore the importance of careful preprocessing method selection and feature reproducibility assessment in developing robust radiomics-based classification models for PD subtypes.

Web based AI-driven framework combining multi-modal data with CNN and LLM for Parkinson's disease diagnosis.	Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a wide spectrum of motor and non-motor symptoms, often leading to delayed or inaccurate diagnosis. Conventional diagnostic methods frequently suffer from limited sensitivity, scalability, and interpretability, thereby restricting their utility in clinical settings. To address these limitations, this study presents a novel AI-driven diagnostic framework that integrates multimodal data fusion, deep learning-based classification, and generative language modeling to improve diagnostic accuracy and enable personalized reporting. The proposed framework leverages the Parkinson's Progression Marker Initiative (PPMI) dataset, incorporating structural Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), Single-Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) imaging, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, and clinical assessments. Statistical analysis was employed to select 14 key biomarkers-including dopamine transporter SBR values and CSF protein levels-from a total of 21 features identified as clinically relevant. A 1D Convolutional Neural Network (1D-CNN) was developed and trained using 121 engineered features, comprising radiomic descriptors and biologically derived metrics. Preprocessing and extensive feature engineering were conducted prior to a 70:30 train-test split, with data augmentation applied to the training set to enhance model generalization. The classifier achieved an accuracy of 93.7%, surpassing baseline approaches and emphasizing the value of domain-informed feature design. To improve interpretability and clinician usability, a Mini ChatGPT-4.0 Large Language Model (LLM) was fine-tuned using approximately 1,000 domain-specific prompt-response pairs generated from literature, classifier-derived eXplainable AI (XAI) feature scores, and expert annotations. The generated responses were evaluated using a custom scoring metric (0.0-5.0) based on their semantic alignment with ground truth completions. This LLM module produces patient-specific diagnostic summaries and treatment suggestions. Additionally, a cloud-based interface was developed to facilitate real-time MRI uploads, automated inference, and chatbot-driven consultations. Overall, the framework demonstrates high diagnostic performance, transparency, and user accessibility, offering significant potential for real-world clinical deployment in PD diagnosis and decision support.

Parkinson's disease mild cognitive impairment with MRI evidence of cholinergic nucleus 4 degeneration: A new subtype?	BACKGROUND: Subtyping Parkinson's disease with mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) into clinically and pathologically homogeneous groups could improve clinical trials and enable personalized treatments. Cholinergic nucleus 4 (Ch4) degeneration has been linked to cognitive decline in PD, suggesting a distinct PD-MCI subtype with worse prognosis. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether PD-MCI patients with MRI evidence of Ch4 degeneration exhibit a different clinical profile and cognitive trajectory than those without Ch4 degeneration. METHODS: We analyzed baseline MRI scans from 162 PD-MCI participants in the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative. Ch4 grey matter density (GMD) was assessed using voxel-based morphometry and probabilistic maps. Participants were classified as having low or normal Ch4 GMD using a z-score threshold of 1 SD below the mean. We compared clinical features and time to cognitive milestones using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. RESULTS: Of 162 participants, 40 had low Ch4 GMD and 122 had normal Ch4 GMD. Those with low Ch4 GMD had significantly worse MDS-UPDRS total and subscale scores (II-III), greater autonomic dysfunction, and reduced olfaction (all P < 0.05). PD-MCI patients with low Ch4 GMD progressed faster to cognitive decline milestones (log-rank P = 0.0017). Subtyping PD-MCI patients by Ch4 GMD may provide more prognostic accuracy for capturing earlier cognitive progression compared to currently established PD subtypes. CONCLUSION: PD-MCI patients with Ch4 degeneration may represent a distinct, clinically severe PD-MCI subtype with faster progression. This group may benefit from targeted inclusion in clinical trials, particularly those assessing cholinergic therapies.	Cholinergic nuclei; Mild cognitive impairment; Parkinson's disease; Subtyping

Characterizing the distinct neuroanatomical phenotypes, cognitive profiles, and transcriptomic signatures of brain structural subtypes in Parkinson's disease with mild cognitive impairment.	BACKGROUND: Parkinson's disease with mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) shows notable heterogeneity in cognitive presentation and progression. Current diagnostic frameworks assume biological homogeneity. Identifying biologically defined subtypes using neuroimaging-based individual biomarkers, cognitive profiles, and molecular signatures can clarify disease heterogeneity and advance precision medicine approaches. METHODS: The study recruited 104 drug-naïve patients with PD-MCI and 107 healthy controls. T1-weighted MRI, diffusion tensor imaging, comprehensive neuropsychological assessments, and transcriptomic data were obtained. Quantile regression normative modeling was applied to create age- and sex-adjusted curves of gray matter volume maturation. Individual deviations were calculated to identify subtypes using the K-means clustering method. Differences in gray matter volume deviations, free water alterations, cognitive performance, transcriptomic associations, and network connectivity patterns were compared across subtypes. External validation was performed in an independent PPMI cohort (n = 115). RESULTS: Two distinct subtypes emerged. Subtype 1 (n = 63) features localized supra-normal gray matter volume deviations in dorsolateral prefrontal regions, elevated free water indicating microstructural disruption, executive dysfunction, and transcriptional enrichment in metabolic dysfunction and neurodegenerative pathways. Subtype 2 (n = 41) displays widespread infra-normal gray matter volume deviations across cortical-limbic areas. Microstructural integrity is preserved despite volumetric reduction, reflecting successful adaptive compensation. Cognitive network connectivity is enhanced (density: 0.95 vs 0.90). Molecular signatures occur in cellular organization and signal transduction pathways. Subtypes show distinct vulnerability patterns in frontal-executive versus limbic-memory networks. External validation in an independent PPMI cohort (n = 115) confirms the two-subtype structure, with consistent reproduction of the fundamental degenerative-adaptive dichotomy despite some regional variability in the validation cohort. CONCLUSIONS: Study findings provide evidence that PD-MCI encompasses biologically distinct subtypes. These subtypes have divergent neuroanatomical patterns, microstructural properties, cognitive profiles, and molecular mechanisms. Multimodal approach reveals fundamental disease heterogeneity and establishes a framework for precision medicine in Parkinson's disease cognitive impairment. Sex-specific distribution across subtypes indicates biological sex should be considered an integral component of PD-MCI heterogeneity rather than a confounding factor. This distribution has important implications for developing sex-specific therapeutic strategies.	Cognitive dysfunction; Magnetic resonance imaging; Parkinson's disease; Phenotype; Transcriptome

Structural and diffusion imaging in olfactory-related brain regions in Parkinson's disease: predictors of clinical progression.	Olfactory dysfunction is a prevalent non-motor symptom in Parkinson's disease (PD). Structural and diffusion MRI studies suggest that olfactory-related brain regions undergo significant neurodegenerative changes in PD. The current study aims to explore the longitudinal structural and diffusion imaging in olfactory-related regions in PD over four years. The relationships between baseline imaging and fluid biomarkers, and subsequent cognitive and clinical changes were also explored. We analyzed 97 newly diagnosed early-stage PD patients from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) who underwent T1-weighted MRI, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and clinical assessments at baseline, two years, and four years. Structural and diffusion measures of olfactory-related regions were extracted using FreeSurfer and ExploreDTI. Baseline fluid biomarkers were also evaluated. Baseline mean diffusivity (MD) displayed significant associations with further cognitive changes across multiple regions, including amygdala, orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), insula, and thalamus (β=-0.214 to - 0.422). Baseline structural measures, including amygdala volume and entorhinal and OFC thickness, were associated with subsequent changes in cognitive and Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) scores (β = 0.264 to 0.402). Moreover, baseline serum neurofilament-light chain levels predicted multiple cognitive score changes (β= - 0.603 to - 0.331). Longitudinal analyses revealed a significant MD increase in the thalamus along with gradual reductions in volume and cortical thickness in the amygdala, insula, OFC, and entorhinal cortex (FDR-adjusted p < 0.05). Linear mixed-effect models further confirmed thalamic diffusion metrics as a predictor of cognitive deterioration. Olfactory-related regions exhibit progressive neurodegeneration in early PD, contributing to worsening cognition and disease severity. Baseline imaging and fluid biomarkers may serve as prognostic tools in PD.

Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease that affects both the motor and nonmotor functions of an individual and is more prevalent in older adults. PD is preceded by an early stage called prodromal PD, which starts very early before the typical symptoms of the disease appear. If patients are managed and diagnosed at this initial stage, their quality of life can be maintained. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a widespread approach in neuroimaging that is very helpful in the diagnosis of brain-related diseases. Current studies of PD classification mostly use T1-weighted MRI or other modalities. T2-FLAIR MRI, including the multimodal techniques that employ it, is understudied despite its ability to reliably identify white matter lesions in the brain, which directly aids in diagnosing PD. In this study, two networks based on deep learning and machine learning are proposed for better and early disease classification using multimodal data, including the T1-weighted, T2-FLAIR MRI, and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score datasets. The datasets were downloaded from an online longitudinal study called the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI). The first network is an ensemble-based network that combines three deep learning models, MobileNet, EfficientNet, and a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and the second network blends a custom CNN trained on both MRI modalities and a multilayer perceptron (MLP) trained on the MoCA score dataset followed by an attention module, thus providing a multimodal fusion network. Both networks achieve efficient results with respect to different evaluation metrics. The ensemble model attained an accuracy of 97.1 %, a sensitivity of 96.2 %, a precision of 96.4 %, an F1 score of 96.3 %, and a specificity of 97.4 %, while the data fusion model achieved an accuracy of 97.9 %, a sensitivity of 97.1 %, a precision of 97.6 %, an F1 score of 97.3 %, and a specificity of 98 %. Grad-CAM analysis was employed to visualize the key brain regions contributing to model decisions, thereby enhancing transparency and clinical relevance.

Cross-regional radiomics: a novel framework for relationship-based feature extraction with validation in Parkinson's disease motor subtyping.	Traditional radiomics approaches focus on single-region feature extraction, limiting their ability to capture complex inter-regional relationships crucial for understanding pathophysiological mechanisms in complex diseases. This study introduces a novel cross-regional radiomics framework that systematically extracts relationship-based features between anatomically and functionally connected brain regions. We analyzed T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data from 140 early-stage Parkinson's disease patients (70 tremor-dominant, 70 postural instability gait difficulty) from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) database across multiple imaging centers. Eight bilateral motor circuit regions (putamen, caudate nucleus, globus pallidus, substantia nigra) were segmented using standardized atlases. Two feature sets were developed: 48 traditional single-region of interest (ROI) features and 60 novel motor-circuit features capturing cross-regional ratios, asymmetry indices, volumetric relationships, and shape distributions. Six feature engineering scenarios were evaluated using center-based 5-fold cross-validation with six machine learning classifiers to ensure robust generalization across different imaging centers. Motor-circuit features demonstrated superior performance compared to single-ROI features across enhanced preprocessing scenarios. Peak performance was achieved with area under the curve (AUC) of 0.821 ± 0.117 versus 0.650 ± 0.220 for single-ROI features (p = 0.0012, Cohen's d = 0.665). Cross-regional ratios, particularly putamen-substantia nigra relationships, dominated the most discriminative features. Motor-circuit features showed superior generalization across multi-center data and better clinical utility through decision curve analysis and calibration curves. The proposed cross-regional radiomics framework significantly outperforms traditional single-region approaches for Parkinson's disease motor subtype classification. This methodology provides a foundation for advancing radiomics applications in complex diseases where inter-regional connectivity patterns are fundamental to pathophysiology.

Automatic differentiation of Parkinson's disease motor subtypes based on deep learning and radiomics.	OBJECTIVE: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder, and the early and accurate differentiation of its motor subtypes is of significant importance for clinical diagnosis and treatment planning. Research has shown that deep brain nuclei such as the thalamus, caudate nucleus, putamen, and globus pallidus play a critical role in the pathogenesis of different motor subtypes of Parkinson's disease. This study aims to utilize deep learning and radiomics technology to establish an automated method for differentiating motor subtypes of Parkinson's disease. METHODS: The data for this study were obtained from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) database, including a total of 135 Parkinson's disease patients, comprising 43 cases of the Postural Instability/Gait Difficulty (PIGD) subtype and 92 cases of the Tremor Dominant (TD) subtype. High-resolution MRI scans were used to extract 2,264 radiomics features from 8 deep brain nuclei, including bilateral thalamus, caudate nucleus, putamen, and globus pallidus. After dimensionality reduction, five independent machine learning classifiers [AdaBoost, Bagging Decision Tree (BDT), Gaussian Process (GP), Logistic Regression (LR), and Random Forest (RF)] were trained on the training set and validated on the test set. Model performance was evaluated using the Area Under the Curve (AUC) metric. RESULTS: After feature selection, 17 most discriminative radiomics features were retained. Among the models, the BDT-based diagnostic model demonstrated the best performance, achieving AUC values of 1.000 and 0.962 on the training and test sets, respectively. DeLong's test results indicated that the BDT model significantly outperformed other models. Calibration curve analysis showed that the Parkinson's disease subtype classification model based on MRI radiomics features exhibited good calibration and stability. Clinical decision curve analysis revealed that the BDT model demonstrated significant clinical net benefits across a wide probability range, indicating high clinical utility. CONCLUSION: The BDT model based on MRI radiomics features constructed in this study exhibited excellent performance in differentiating motor subtypes of Parkinson's disease and can serve as an effective tool for clinical auxiliary diagnosis. This fully automated model is capable of processing MRI data and providing results within 3 min, offering an efficient and reliable solution for the early differentiation of Parkinson's disease motor subtypes, with significant clinical application value.

Association of long-term glycemic variability with longitudinal motor and nonmotor progression in patients with Parkinson's disease: an 8-year follow-up.	BACKGROUND: Although recent evidence suggests that glycemic variability (GV) has a negative impact on neurodegeneration, its role in Parkinson's disease (PD) remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: To explore the association between long-term GV and longitudinal motor and nonmotor progression in patients with PD and to uncover the disease-specific and nonspecific mechanisms underlying this association. METHODS: We used data obtained from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative cohort. Three hundred seventy-seven patients with early untreated PD underwent annual motor and nonmotor assessments covering neuropsychiatric, sleep-related, and autonomic symptoms for up to 8 years of follow-up. Dopamine transporter (DAT) imaging results and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) marker levels, including α-synuclein, β-amyloid 1-42, total tau, phosphorylated tau181, and neurofilament light chain (NfL) were collected at baseline and for up to 6 years of follow-up. We defined GV as the intra-individual visit-to-visit variability in annual fasting blood glucose levels. RESULTS: With respect to motor symptoms, a greater GV was associated with a greater increase in postural instability/gait difficulty scores (P = .001) and a greater risk of developing freezing of gait (P = .002). With respect to nonmotor symptoms, higher GV was associated with a steeper decrease in Montreal Cognitive Assessment (P < .001) and semantic fluency test (P = .002) scores and a greater increase in Geriatric Depression Scale scores (P = .001). With respect to DAT imaging and CSF biomarkers, increased GV was associated with a greater increase in CSF NfL levels (P = .001) but not with other biomarker changes. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that increased GV is related to unfavourable motor and nonmotor outcomes in patients with PD. However, we did not identify the specific mechanisms underlying these GV-related effects, despite its association with more severe neurodegeneration.

The association of glymphatic system function with cognitive decline in PD-FOG: multimodal MRI evidence from cross-sectional and longitudinal studies.	This study aims to investigate glymphatic system dysfunction in idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) using a dual-cohort design, focusing on its associations with freezing of gait (FOG) and cognitive decline. A cross-sectional analysis was conducted on 43 PD patients with FOG, 106 without FOG, and 46 healthy controls. A longitudinal study followed 146 early-stage PD patients from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative database over five years, with 65 developing FOG. Covariate analysis was performed, controlling for variables like gender, age, and education. Survival analysis compared cognitive decline between FOG and stable groups. Random forest analysis identified key predictors of FOG development. The cross-sectional study demonstrated significantly enlarged normalized choroid plexus volume in PD patients with FOG compared to healthy controls. Both FOG and non-FOG groups showed increased perivascular space enlargement in the basal ganglia and centrum semiovale, as well as reduced average analysis along the perivascular space index compared to healthy controls. PD patients with FOG exhibited more pronounced disease progression and cognitive decline than those without FOG. Glymphatic markers were associated with age, cognitive scores, and gait performance. The longitudinal study showed slightly more severe motor symptoms and accelerated cognitive decline in the FOG group during follow-up. Random forest analysis identified age, cognitive scales, and glymphatic function metrics as robust predictors of FOG development. These findings highlight the potential significance of brain glymphatic system function in the development of freezing of gait and cognitive decline in PD patients, offering novel neuroimaging biomarkers for early detection.

OBJECTIVE: Parkinson's disease (PD) presents challenges in early diagnosis and progression prediction. Recent advancements in machine learning, particularly convolutional-neural-networks (CNNs), show promise in enhancing diagnostic accuracy and prognostic capabilities using neuroimaging data. The aims of this study were: (i) develop a 3D-CNN based on MRI to distinguish controls and PD patients and (ii) employ CNN to predict the progression of PD. METHODS: Three cohorts were selected: 86 mild, 62 moderate-to-severe PD patients, and 60 controls; 14 mild-PD patients and 14 controls from Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative database, and 38 de novo mild-PD patients and 38 controls. All participants underwent MRI scans and clinical evaluation at baseline and over 2-years. PD subjects were classified in two clusters of different progression using k-means clustering based on baseline and follow-up UDPRS-III scores. A 3D-CNN was built and tested on PD patients and controls, with binary classifications: controls vs moderate-to-severe PD, controls vs mild-PD, and two clusters of PD progression. The effect of transfer learning was also tested. RESULTS: CNN effectively differentiated moderate-to-severe PD from controls (74% accuracy) using MRI data alone. Transfer learning significantly improved performance in distinguishing mild-PD from controls (64% accuracy). For predicting disease progression, the model achieved over 70% accuracy by combining MRI and clinical data. Brain regions most influential in the CNN's decisions were visualized. CONCLUSIONS: CNN, integrating multimodal data and transfer learning, provides encouraging results toward early-stage classification and progression monitoring in PD. Its explainability through activation maps offers potential for clinical application in early diagnosis and personalized monitoring.	MRI; Machine learning; Parkinson’s disease

Rapid frontotemporal gray matter loss in proposed body-first Parkinson's disease: a longitudinal voxel-based morphometry study.	OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to compare the progressive gray matter (GM) atrophy between brain-first and body-first Parkinson's disease (PD) under assumption. METHODS: Based on the hypothesis that the timing of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD) onset relative to motor symptoms may differentiate brain-first from body-first PD subtypes, we stratified PD patients from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) database into 28 RBD-positive PD patients (PDRBD+), 26 RBD-negative PD patients (PDRBD-), 33 isolated RBD (iRBD) patients, and 35 healthy controls. PDRBD+ and PDRBD- groups underwent 4 visits within 48 months including clinical assessments and structure MRI. We measured GM atrophy cross-sectionally and longitudinally and analyzed their associations with other proposed markers. RESULTS: At baseline, all groups were comparable and showed no significant difference in GM volume (GMV). The longitudinal GMV analysis (group-by-time interaction) showed that, compared with PDRBD- group, PDRBD+ demonstrated significant GM loss in the medial surface of the frontal lobes and the left temporal lobe. In the comparison at the 48th month, besides the bilateral frontotemporal lobes, the PDRBD+ group showed significant GM atrophy in the bilateral cerebellum. The two groups had no significant differences in the 12th and 24th months. Over time, each PD group showed extensive cortical GM loss and bilateral caudate and putamen atrophy. The altered GMV (interaction effect) was positively associated with the MoCA scores and negatively with SCOPA-AUT. Furthermore, the group-level F-statistic map highlighted spatially distinct differences in the protein metabolism, signal transduction, and autophagy pathways between PDRBD+ and PDRBD- groups. CONCLUSION: Body-first PD patients show a relatively rapid GMV loss in specific frontotemporal regions (e.g., left middle temporal gyrus) within 6 years following motor symptoms.

ModFus-PD: synergizing cross-modal attention and contrastive learning for enhanced multimodal diagnosis of Parkinson's disease.	Parkinson's disease (PD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a high rate of misdiagnosis, underscoring the critical importance of early and accurate diagnosis. Although existing computer-aided diagnostic systems integrate clinical assessment scales with neuroimaging data, they typically rely on superficial feature concatenation, which fails to capture the deep inter-modal dependencies essential for effective multimodal fusion. To address this limitation, we propose ModFus-PD, Contrastive learning effectively aligns heterogeneous modalities such as imaging and clinical text, while the cross-modal attention mechanism further exploits semantic interactions between them to enhance feature fusion. The framework comprises three key components: (1) a contrastive learning-based feature alignment module that projects MRI data and clinical text prompts into a unified embedding space via pretrained image and text encoders; (2) a bidirectional cross-modal attention module in which textual semantics guide MRI feature refinement for improved sensitivity to PD-related brain regions, while MRI features simultaneously enhance the contextual understanding of clinical text; (3) a hierarchical classification module that integrates the fused representations through two fully connected layers to produce final PD classification probabilities. Experiments on the PPMI dataset demonstrate the superior performance of ModFus-PD, achieving an accuracy of 0.903, AUC of 0.892, and F1 score of 0.840, surpassing several state-of-the-art baselines. These results validate the effectiveness of our cross-modal fusion strategy, which enables interpretable and reliable diagnostic support, holding promise for future clinical translation.	contrastive learning; crossmodal attention; early diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease; multimodal fusion; multimodal representation learning

Brain structural MRI marker for predicting conversion to Parkinson's disease in individuals with prodromal symptoms.	BACKGROUND: During the prodromal stage of Parkinson's disease (PD), brain structural alterations precede clinical diagnosis and offer opportunities for early detection. We investigated whether combining clinical non-motor markers with an MRI-based brain structural marker could enhance predictive performance for PD conversion. METHODS: Individuals with prodromal symptoms ( RESULTS: Six individuals converted to PD within 4 years. The MRI marker classified 21 individuals as having PD-like brain patterns, including all six converters. When combined with olfactory dysfunction, the approach achieved optimal performance with 100% sensitivity, 80% specificity, and 90% balanced accuracy, outperforming individual markers and other combinations. CONCLUSION: MRI-quantified brain structural similarity to PD, particularly when combined with olfactory assessment, significantly enhances prediction of PD conversion in individuals with prodromal symptoms. This accessible, multimodal approach could facilitate early identification of high-risk individuals for targeted interventions and clinical trials.

Development of a population of digital brain phantoms for radionuclide imaging research in Parkinson's disease.	PURPOSE: Dopamine transporter (DAT) SPECT is a powerful tool for early diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD), while digital phantoms and Monte Carlo (MC) simulations can serve as important research tools. This study aims to develop a novel digital brain phantom population for METHODS: Striatum, brain background (gray and white matter), and cold regions (skull and cerebrospinal fluid) were segmented from 200 T1 MRI brain images from the PPMI dataset. Striatal binding ratio (SBR) values were retrospectively collected from 200 RESULTS: A population of 1000 normal and abnormal PD phantoms was generated for both tracers. Visual comparisons and quantitative analyses demonstrated that simulated data exhibited high similarity to clinical data. Reconstructed images with AC + SC achieved the best quantitative results, followed by AC only, without AC and SC, and SC only. CONCLUSION: The developed digital DAT SPECT phantom population can be served for a wide range of PD applications. Attenuation impacts image quality the most in DAT SPECT, while AC + SC is effective to enhance image quality and quantitative accuracy of DAT SPECT.

A predictive model of Parkinsonian brain aging based on brain imaging features.	INTRODUCTION: This study explores the use of imaging to evaluate brain aging to establish a model for predicting brain age in patients with Parkinson's disease. METHODS: Structural brain MRI data from 345 healthy individuals were obtained from the IXI database, while data from 59 Parkinson's patients and 59 healthy controls were acquired from the PPMI database. A total of 1214 structural indicators were extracted, including information on the whole brain, cortex, subcortex, and white matter. This led to the development of a model for predicting brain age in Parkinson's patients. The model combined brain imaging features with a machine learning algorithm and the Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) interpretation model. Fifteen characteristic indicators most closely associated with Parkinson's brain aging were determined. RESULTS: The XGBoost model + SHAP method framework, using the minimum mean absolute error for assessing brain aging within 4.21 years, was effective in predicting brain age in patients with Parkinson's disease. The superior temporal folding index and subcortical gray matter volume, left thalamus volume, and left and right vascular volumes had the most significant impact on the prediction results, suggesting their potential as clinical indicators for evaluating the extent of brain aging in Parkinson's patients. DISCUSSION: These findings provide important clues for understanding the mechanisms underlying brain aging, as well as brain imaging evidence for the early diagnosis and treatment of Parkinson's disease.

Prediction of Motor Symptom Progression of Parkinson's Disease Through Multimodal Imaging-Based Machine Learning.	The unrelenting progression of Parkinson's disease (PD) leads to severely impaired quality of life, with considerable variability in progression rates among patients. Identifying biomarkers of PD progression could improve clinical monitoring and management. Radiomics, which facilitates data extraction from imaging for use in machine learning models, offers a promising approach to this challenge. This study investigated the use of multi-modality imaging, combining conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and dopamine transporter single photon emission computed tomography (DAT-SPECT), to predict motor progression in PD. Motor progression was measured by changes in the Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) motor subscale scores. Radiomic features were selected from the midbrain region in MRI and caudate nucleus, putamen, and ventral striatum in DAT-SPECT. Patients were stratified into fast progression vs. slow progression based on change in MDS-UPDRS in follow-up. Various feature selection methods and machine learning classifiers were evaluated for each modality, and the best-performing models were combined into an ensemble. On the internal test set, the ensemble model, which integrated clinical information, T1WI, T2WI and DAT-SPECT achieved a ROC AUC of 0.93 (95% CI: 0.80-1.00), PR AUC of 0.88 (95%CI 0.61-1.00), accuracy of 0.85 (95% CI: 0.70-0.89), sensitivity of 0.72 (95% CI: 0.43-1.00), and specificity of 0.92 (95% CI: 0.77-1.00). On the external test set, the ensemble model outperformed single-modality models with a ROC AUC of 0.77 (95% CI: 0.53-0.93), PR AUC of 0.79 (95% CI: 0.56-0.95), accuracy of 0.68 (95% CI: 0.50-0.86), sensitivity of 0.53 (95% CI: 0.27-0.82), and specificity of 0.82 (95% CI: 0.55-1.00). In conclusion, this study developed an imaging-based model to identify baseline characteristics predictive of disease progression in PD patients. The findings highlight the strength of using multiple imaging modalities and integrating imaging data with clinical information to enhance the prediction of motor progression in PD.

Machine learning-based brain magnetic resonance imaging radiomics for identifying rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder in Parkinson's disease patients.	BACKGROUND: Traditional clinical diagnostic methods of rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD) have certain limitations, especially in the early stages. This study aims to develop and validate an magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) radiomics-based machine learning classifier to accurately detect RBD patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). METHODS: Data from 183 subjects, including 63 PD patients with RBD, sourced from the PPMI database were utilized in this study. The data were randomly divided into training (70%) and testing (30%) sets. Quantitative radiomic features of white matter, gray matter, and cerebrospinal fluid were extracted from whole-brain structural MRI images. Feature reduction was performed on the training set data to construct radiomics signatures. Additionally, multi-factor logistic regression analysis identified clinical predictors associated with PD-RBD, and these clinical features were integrated with the radiomics signatures to develop predictive models using various machine learning algorithms. The model exhibiting the best performance was selected, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to evaluate its performance in both the training and testing sets. Furthermore, based on the optimal cut-off value of the model, subjects were categorized into low- and high-risk groups, and differences in the actual number of RBD patients between the two sets were compared to assess the clinical effectiveness of the model. RESULTS: The radiomics signatures achieved areas under the curve (AUC) of 0.754 and 0.707 in the training and testing sets, respectively. Multi-factor logistic regression analysis revealed that postural instability was an independent predictor of PD-RBD. The random forest model, which integrated radiomics signatures with postural instability, demonstrated superior performance in predicting PD-RBD. Specifically, its AUCs in the training and testing sets were 0.917 and 0.882, with sensitivities of 0.933 and 0.889, and specificities of 0.786 and 0.722, respectively. Based on the optimal cut-off value of 0.3772, significant differences in the actual number of PD-RBD patients were observed between low-risk and high-risk groups in both the training and testing sets (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: MRI-based radiomic signatures have the potential to serve as biomarkers for PD-RBD. The random forest model, which integrates radiomic signatures with postural instability, and shows improved performance in identifying PD-RBD. This approach offers valuable insights for prognostic evaluation and preventive treatment strategies.

Unsupervised subtyping of motor dysfunction of Parkinson's disease and its structural brain imaging correlates.	BACKGROUND: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a clinical neurodegenerative disorder. The Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) has been used as a standard measure of the PD symptom profile, and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is widely used for identifying the critical brain regions involved in PD progression. OBJECTIVES: The present study aimed to (1) identify PD subtypes based on the motor dysfunction profile in the MDS-UPDRS and (2) find the differences in gray matter volumes of brain regions, and (3) compare non-motor features between the subtypes to explore their distinct clinical profiles. METHODS: In total, 299 patients with PD and 173 healthy participants from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative were included. A software package, Generalized Association Plots, was used to cluster the motor dysfunction profile in the MDS-UPDRS. Regression models and the Artificial Intelligence Platform as a Service were used to quantify the differences in gray matter volume of brain regions between subtypes. RESULTS: We identified three PD subtypes-resting tremor, intermediate, and akinetic-rigid-using motor symptom clustering. MRI analysis revealed significant differences in brain regions, including the posterior cingulate gyrus, lenticular nucleus, olfactory cortex, and cerebellum. Non-motor features, such as cognitive decline and autonomic dysfunctions, varied across subtypes, highlighting distinct systemic profiles. Akinetic-rigid patients exhibited the most severe impairments, while tremor-dominant patients showed milder non-motor symptoms. DISCUSSION: Three PD subtypes of motor dysfunction were identified. Structural brain imaging revealed subtype-specific differences not only in cingulum and putamen regions, but also in the olfactory cortex, parahippocampal gyrus, and cerebellum, correlating with motor symptoms. Non-motor features varied by subtype, with increasing severity from tremor-dominant to akinetic-rigid.	Machine learning; Motor dysfunction subtypes; Parkinson's disease; Structural brain imaging

Unveiling the neural network of freezing of gait in Parkinson's disease: A coordinate-based network study.	BackgroundFreezing of gait (FoG) is a debilitating symptom in Parkinson's disease (PD), yet its pathophysiological mechanisms remain poorly understood. Several studies have investigated the FoG neuroimaging correlates, with heterogeneous results.ObjectiveThis study investigated in a large PD cohort whether the disparate neuroimaging findings may converge to a common brain network.MethodsT1-weighted MRI scans of 500 PD patients (90 with FoG [PD-FoG] and 410 without FoG [PD-nFoG]) were acquired from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative. A voxel-based morphometry (VBM) analysis was conducted to identify clusters of decreased grey matter (GM) in PD-FoG patients. Subsequently, VBM coordinates of significant clusters were used as seed regions to generate connectivity network maps using a large functional normative connectome, and these maps were overlapped to identify regions connected with most VBM clusters.ResultsPD-FoG patients showed GM atrophy in cerebellar lobes, hippocampus, putamen, insula, inferior temporal gyrus and lateral orbitofrontal gyrus compared with PD-nFoG patients. Network analysis revealed that these regions colocalized within a specific brain network focused on midbrain, substantia nigra, subthalamic nucleus, globus pallidus, inferior putamen and dorsal medial cerebellum. These findings were confirmed by using coordinates from previous VBM studies for the network analysis, validating our results.ConclusionsThis study revealed a brain network underlying FoG in PD, reducing the heterogeneity of previous neuroimaging evidence on FoG. These results may represent a significant step forward in the understanding of FoG and may be relevant for optimized targeted neuro-modulatory treatments to reduce FoG in PD patients. Freezing of gait (FoG) is a disabling symptom that can occur in Parkinson's disease (PD), where people suddenly find it difficult to start walking or continue moving. This can cause their feet to feel “stuck to the floor” and often happens when turning, walking in tight spaces, or during stressful situations. FoG is typically more commonly observed in the advanced stages of the disease, though not all individuals with PD experience FoG, and can significantly impact daily life and increase the risk of falling. In this study, we used advanced brain imaging techniques to understand what happens in the brain when FoG occurs. We analyzed MRI scans of 480 people with PD, comparing those who experience FoG with those who do not. We found specific areas of the brain where the gray matter was reduced in people with FoG. Using a modern mapping technique, we discovered that these brain areas are part of a connected network involving regions important for movement control, such as the midbrain, globus pallidus, and cerebellum. Our findings suggest that FoG in PD is linked to dysfunction in a brain network, rather than in a single brain region. This understanding may help identify targets for treatments, like deep brain stimulation or other therapies, to improve movement and reduce freezing episodes in people with PD.

CSF Biomarker-Based Cognitive Trajectories in Parkinson's Disease-Subjective Cognitive Decline.	OBJECTIVE: Cognitive complaints without objective cognitive impairment in Parkinson's Disease, termed Parkinson's Disease-Subjective Cognitive Decline (PD-SCD), have been associated with cognitive decline. However, its progression is heterogeneous, highlighting the need for improved identification of patients at greater risk for deterioration. This cohort study aims to investigate associations between CSF biomarkers and cognitive decline in PD-SCD. METHODS: We included patients from the PPMI cohort with PD-SCD, available baseline CSF beta-amyloid RESULTS: A total of 80 patients were included, with a mean age of 62.1 years and a median disease duration of 5.6 months at baseline.

Advanced brain aging, selective vulnerability in gray matter, and cognition in Parkinson's disease.	BACKGROUND: To identify the most vulnerable brain regions in gray matter attributable to advanced brain aging and examine the cognitive correlates of advanced brain aging in Parkinson's disease (PD). METHODS: One hundred twenty-five early-stage PD patients with both structural, diffusion MRI and DAT-SPECT data available were included at baseline (year 0) from Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative, with neuroimaging follow-up at year 1, 2, 4. Annual assessment of cognition was performed in 5 years. The relationships between brain-predicted age difference (PAD), free water (FW) in cortical and subcortical gray matter, and cognition were examined with linear regression and linear mixed-effects model. Cox proportional hazards model was used to investigate the relation between brain PAD and the risk of conversion to mild cognitive impairment (MCI). RESULTS: One hundred twenty-five PD patients with a mean (SD) chronological age of 60.99 (9.50) years and 82 (65.6%) were men. Brain PAD followed a non-linear progression pattern over time (P = .028). Brain PAD was differentially associated with FW in cortical and subcortical gray matter, with the most preferentially vulnerable regions identified as temporal cortex, striatum, hippocampus, and cholinergic basal forebrain. Baseline brain PAD was associated with cognitive deficits and the conversion to MCI during the 5-year follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that brain PAD offers potential in pinpointing regions most susceptible to accelerated brain aging and identifying patients with Parkinson's disease who are at an increased risk of converting to mild cognitive impairment. .

Cortical connectivity predicts cognition across time in Parkinson's disease.	Cognitive symptoms are common in Parkinson's disease (PD), yet the underlying brain mechanisms remain poorly understood. To address this gap, we investigated the relationship between functional connectivity and cognition at multiple time points using longitudinal functional MRI (fMRI) and cognitive assessments from the Parkinson's Progression Marker Initiative (PPMI). We calculated resting-state functional connectivity within and between three key cortical brain networks that have been linked with cognitive function in PD: the frontoparietal network (FPN); the salience network (SAL); and the default mode network (DMN). Cognitive function was assessed with the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Linear mixed-effects modeling revealed that decreased FPN-DMN functional connectivity is associated with lower MoCA scores over time. This finding suggests that cortical connectivity is associated with and may contribute to the progression of cognitive symptoms in PD. Our findings advance knowledge about cognitive changes in PD and emphasize the importance of functional brain network architecture.

BACKGROUND: Loss of Y chromosome (LOY), an age-related somatic mutation, is associated with various age-related diseases, but its role in the onset and progression of Parkinson's disease (PD) remains unclear. This study investigated the relationship between blood LOY levels and the risk of PD onset and progression. METHODS: We estimated the LOY level for each male participant based on genome-wide arrays or whole genome sequencing data. We performed Cox proportional hazards regression analysis among 222,598 male participants in the UK Biobank and linear mixed model analysis involving 2574 male individuals with PD across 14 cohorts, encompassing 19,562 visits. In the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) cohort, we further compared brain structure using T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, and carried out brain network functional connectivity analysis based on resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) datasets. Additionally, we assessed the LOY status in single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) data, which included 1,303,531 cells from 279 post-mortem samples across five brain regions, and performed temporal dynamic gene expression analysis. FINDINGS: Male participants with LOY had a slightly higher risk of developing PD during follow-up (HR = 1·16, 95% CI = 1·01-1·34, P = 0·04). Among males affected by PD, LOY carriers experienced accelerated neurodegenerative progression, manifesting as more rapid motor impairment (P = 0·0072) and cognitive decline (P = 0·0005) compared to non-LOY carriers. Patients with PD carrying LOY also exhibited decreased network functional connectivity in certain brain regions. Notably, LOY cells were particularly enriched in microglia/immune and vascular/epithelial cells, and a subset of genes in LOY-Mic P2RY12 cells were associated with PD progression. INTERPRETATION: This data-driven study highlights the potential association of LOY with the onset and progression of PD through the analysis of multi-scale data, including clinical phenotypes, brain neuroimaging maps, and molecular profiles from single-nucleus transcriptome across multi-brain regions. These findings suggest that LOY may be an accomplice to the onset and progression of PD.

Free Water (FW) is considered an indicator of neuroinflammation, while the Index of Diffusivity along the Perivascular Space (ALPS) is a recently introduced measure of glymphatic function. However, no study has yet investigated the specific relationships between these factors simultaneously. This study aimed to examine changes in FW in the thalamic midline and lateral nuclei in Parkinson's disease (PD), with a particular focus on the potential influence of glymphatic system dysfunction. MRI data and clinical information were obtained from 32 healthy controls (HC), 32 participants with prodromal PD (pPD), and 90 participants with PD, sourced from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) database. The ALPS index and Free Water fractional volume (FWF) were calculated based on diffusion tensor images. Intergroup comparisons of and correlations among MRI measures and clinical assessments were analyzed. FWF was elevated in the bilateral thalamic midline and right lateral nuclei of PD and in right midline nuclei of pPD compared to HC. In the PD group, the right ALPS index was significantly and negatively associated with FWF in the bilateral thalamic lateral nuclei, and mean ALPS index was negatively correlated to FWF in right lateral nuclei. Moreover, FWF in the right lateral thalamic nuclei of PD was correlated with follow-up Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scores and its 2-years decrease rate. We provided indirect evidence to support that thalamic FW was significantly increased in PD participants, potentially exacerbated by glymphatic system dysfunction.

Subregional analysis of the amygdala, thalamus, and hypothalamus at the pre-decline stage in Parkinson's disease with later cognitive impairment.	Cognitive decline in Parkinson's disease (PD) significantly impacts patients' quality of life, yet early detection remains challenging. While structural brain abnormalities in cortical regions have been widely documented using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), subcortical regions have received less analytical attention despite their potential role as early biomarkers. This study investigated changes in specific subregions of the amygdala, thalamus, and hypothalamus in patients with PD before cognitive decline development. We analyzed MRI data from 163 participants (97 healthy controls [HC] and 66 patients with PD) from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative database. The patients with PD were classified based on cognitive status during a four-year follow-up: 21 who developed cognitive impairment (PDCI) and 45 who maintained normal cognition (PDNC). Cognitive function was assessed using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment and domain-specific tests. The PDCI group showed significantly lower corrected brain volumes in specific subregions of the amygdala (left basal nucleus), thalamus (bilateral lateral geniculate nuclei, right medial dorsal nucleus, and right anterior pulvinar nucleus), and hypothalamus (bilateral anterior-superior and left superior tubular parts) compared to that of HC. A significant difference between the PDCI and PDNC groups was observed only in the left lateral geniculate nucleus. In contrast, widespread structural changes were observed in cortical regions in the PDCI group, which showed stronger correlations with memory, attention, executive function, and visuospatial abilities. Hazard ratio analysis confirmed that structural changes in multiple cortical regions were significant predictors of cognitive decline. Although structural alterations were observed in subcortical regions, cortical changes demonstrated stronger associations with cognitive decline. These findings suggest that structural abnormalities may appear in the cerebral cortex before the stage proposed by conventional α-synuclein propagation models, potentially involving multiple mechanisms beyond α-synuclein, including global neural circuit dysfunction, disruption of neurotransmitter systems, breakdown of compensatory mechanisms, and coexisting pathologies (beta-amyloid and tau proteins). This study provides insights into early brain changes in PD and emphasizes the need for a comprehensive approach considering multiple mechanisms in early diagnosis and intervention strategies for PD-related cognitive impairment.

Distinct Longitudinal Clinical-Neuroanatomical Trajectories in Parkinson's Disease Clinical Subtypes: Insight toward Precision Medicine.	"BACKGROUND: Parkinson's disease (PD) varies widely across individuals in clinical manifestations and course of progression. Identification of distinct biological subtypes could explain this heterogeneity, identify its pathophysiology, and predict disease progression. OBJECTIVES: Our aim was to compare longitudinal clinical trajectories and brain atrophy patterns between clinical subtypes defined at the baseline de novo PD. METHODS: We analyzed data from 421 PD patients (mean follow-up: 8.2 years) in the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI). Using multi-domain motor and non-motor criteria, de novo patients were classified into ""mild motor-predominant"" (n = 223), ""intermediate"" (n = 146), and ""diffuse-malignant"" (n = 52) subtypes. Deformation-based morphometry was performed on T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRIs) from 128 PD patients with at least two MRIs (71 mild motor-predominant, 42 intermediate, and 15 diffuse-malignant) and 60 controls, with an average MRI follow-up duration of 3.4 ± 1.1 in the PD cohort. Mixed-effects models compared clinical progression and longitudinal pattern of regional atrophy across subtypes. RESULTS: The diffuse-malignant subtype exhibited faster worsening of motor severity (P = 0.007), cognition (P < 0.0001), and activities of daily living (P < 0.0001) compared to mild motor-predominant subtype over 8 years. These findings remained statistically significant after an age-matched subgroup analysis and adjustment for the levodopa treatment. Accelerated atrophy was observed in the precuneus, temporal and fusiform gyri, cerebellum, and other regions (corrected-P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Longitudinal analysis revealed distinct patterns of clinical progression and regional atrophy in PD subtypes, with the diffuse-malignant subtype showing more severe neurodegeneration and clinical deterioration suggesting existence of diverse pathophysiological mechanisms in PD. © 2025 The Author(s).

The impact of impulse control disorders on cognitive decline in	"BACKGROUND: Impulse control disorders (ICDs) are common neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS), which are prevalent among patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Current research has not clarified the impact of ICDs on cognitive function nor provided sufficient objective evidence. This study aims to explore the effects of ICDs on cognitive functions in PD patients, and further investigate associated cerebral structural changes. METHODS: Two hundred PD patients with normal cognition (PDNC) and 69 healthy controls were included from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI), among these PDNC, 81 patients with ""pure"" ICDs (p-ICDs), 69 ICDs combined with other NPS (c-ICDs), and 50 patients without NPS. The cognitive status of each PD patient was obtained every year in four-year follow-up. The difference in conversion rates was obtained by chi-square test. Survival analysis was used to explore the conversion time difference among these groups. Further analysis was conducted on the potential structural difference. Finally, the correlation between significant brain structural changes and neuropsychological assessments were evaluated. RESULTS: The survival analysis suggested that the conversion time of p-ICDs from normal cognition to MCI was significantly delayed compared to NPS-negative, with no significant difference relative to the c-ICDs. There is no significant difference in conversion rates among them. Morphological analysis revealed that compared to the NPS-negative group, the p-ICDs and c-ICDs groups exhibited thickness changes in certain regions (Bonferroni-corrected, CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that ICDs might exert a protective effect against cognitive decline, potentially delay the occurrence of MCI in PDNC, which could be associated with alterations in cortical thickness."

Data-driven characterization of distinct cognitive subtypes in Parkinson's disease dementia.	Individual cognitive profiles of patients with Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD) are highly heterogeneous, suggesting possible biological subtypes. We studied 75 PD patients who developed dementia in the course of the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative study to investigate data-driven evidence for the existence of distinct cognitive subtypes of PDD. Using Ward's hierarchical clustering on neuropsychological test data, we identified two distinct cognitive subtypes. Despite similar dementia severity (MoCA: 20.6 vs 20.0), cluster-A exhibited more pronounced memory deficits (n = 50), whereas cluster-B showed greater visuospatial impairments (n = 25). The subtypes did not differ in demographic, motor, or MRI-based neurodegeneration measures. However, the visuospatial-predominant cluster-B had a higher prevalence of GBA mutations (p = 0.003) and hallucinations (p = 0.009). No differences were found in APOE-ε4 prevalence or cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers of Alzheimer's pathology. These findings reveal distinct memory-predominant and visuospatial-predominant PDD subtypes, which associate with different clinical and genetic features but are independent of comorbid Alzheimer's pathology.

Neuroimaging-based data-driven subtypes of spatiotemporal atrophy due to Parkinson's disease.	Parkinson's disease is the second most common neurodegenerative disease. Despite this, there are no robust biomarkers to predict progression, and understanding of disease mechanisms is limited. We used the Subtype and Stage Inference algorithm to characterize Parkinson's disease heterogeneity in terms of spatiotemporal subtypes of macroscopic atrophy detectable on T1-weighted MRI-a successful approach used in other neurodegenerative diseases. We trained the model on covariate-adjusted cortical thicknesses and subcortical volumes from the largest known T1-weighted MRI dataset in Parkinson's disease, Enhancing Neuroimaging through Meta-Analysis consortium Parkinson's Disease dataset (	ENIGMA-PD; PPMI; clustering; disease progression modelling; neurodegeneration

Machine Learning-Based Diagnostic Prediction Model Using T1-Weighted Striatal Magnetic Resonance Imaging for Early-Stage Parkinson's Disease Detection.	RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: Diagnosing Parkinson's disease (PD) typically relies on clinical evaluations, often detecting it in advanced stages. Recently, artificial intelligence has increasingly been applied to imaging for neurodegenerative disorders. This study aims to develop a diagnostic prediction model using T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (T1-MRI) data from the caudate and putamen in individuals with early-stage PD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective case-control study included 69 early-stage PD patients and 22 controls, recruited through the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative. T1-MRI scans were acquired using a 3-tesla system. 432 radiomic features were extracted from images of the segmented caudate and putâmen in an automated way. Feature selection was performed using Pearson's correlation and recursive feature elimination to identify the most relevant variables. Three machine learning algorithms-random forest (RF), support vector machine and logistic regression-were evaluated for diagnostic prediction effectiveness using a cross-validation method. The Shapley Additive Explanations technique identified the most significant features distinguishing between the groups. The metrics used to evaluate the performance were discrimination, expressed in area under the ROC curve (AUC), sensitivity and specificity; and calibration, expressed as accuracy. RESULTS: The RF algorithm showed superior performance with an average accuracy of 92.85%, precision of 100.00%, sensitivity of 86.66%, specificity of 96.65% and AUC of 0.93. The three most influential features were contrast, elongation, and gray-level non-uniformity, all from the putamen. CONCLUSION: Machine learning-based models can differentiate early-stage PD from controls using T1-weighted MRI radiomic features.

Divergent amygdala function in proposed brain-first and body-first Parkinson's disease: a resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging study.	BACKGROUND: The newly proposed α-Synuclein Origin and Connectome (SOC) Model classifies Parkinson's disease (PD) patients into brain-first and body-first subtypes. In brain-first patients, α-synuclein may originate in the amygdala of one cerebral hemisphere and disseminate ipsilaterally via the neural connectome. This study aimed to investigate the differences in clinical characteristics and amygdala function between these two subtypes and to evaluate whether amygdala function could serve as a marker for subtype distinctions. METHODS: Resting-state functional MRI data of 66 early-stage PD patients and 17 healthy controls (HC) were retrieved from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative database. PD patients with REM Sleep Behavior Disorder (RBD) were classified as the body-first subtype, while those without RBD were classified as the brain-first subtype. RESULTS: We found that body-first patients had a longer disease duration and more severe autonomic dysfunction compared to brain-first patients. Amygdala-related FC in brain-first patients was similar to that in the HC group, with both groups showing stronger FC between the bilateral amygdala and the right postcentral gyrus than body-first patients. Importantly, the abnormal amygdala-related FC was negatively correlated with SCOPA-Aut scores (r = -0.361, P = 0.002) in PD patients. ROC analysis indicated that the area under the curve for the FC was 0.834. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that the amygdala-related FC may serve as an effective indicator to differentiate brain-first and body-first subtypes. Moreover, functional abnormalities in the amygdala contribute to autonomic dysfunction, rather than depression or anxiety in early-stage PD patients. Further validation of these findings in trials with larger cohorts is needed.	Parkinson's disease; Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder; Resting-state functional MRI; Α-Synuclein spread

Predicting Parkinson's disease trajectory using clinical and functional MRI features: A reproduction and replication study.	Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder with a poorly understood physiopathology and no established biomarkers for the diagnosis of early stages and for prediction of disease progression. Several neuroimaging biomarkers have been studied recently, but these are susceptible to several sources of variability related for instance to cohort selection or image analysis. In this context, an evaluation of the robustness of such biomarkers to variations in the data processing workflow is essential. This study is part of a larger project investigating the replicability of potential neuroimaging biomarkers of PD. Here, we attempt to fully reproduce (reimplementing the experiments with the same methods, including data collection from the same database) and replicate (different data and/or method) the models described in (Nguyen et al., 2021) to predict individual's PD current state and progression using demographic, clinical and neuroimaging features (fALFF and ReHo extracted from resting-state fMRI). We use the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative dataset (PPMI, ppmi-info.org), as in (Nguyen et al., 2021) and aim to reproduce the original cohort, imaging features and machine learning models as closely as possible using the information available in the paper and the code. We also investigated methodological variations in cohort selection, feature extraction pipelines and sets of input features. Different criteria were used to evaluate the reproduction attempt and compare the results with the original ones. Notably, we obtained significantly better than chance performance using the analysis pipeline closest to that in the original study (R2 > 0), which is consistent with its findings. In addition, we performed a partial reproduction using derived data provided by the authors of the original study, and we obtained results that were close to the original ones. The challenges encountered while attempting to reproduce (fully and partially) and replicating the original work are likely explained by the complexity of neuroimaging studies, in particular in clinical settings. We provide recommendations to further facilitate the reproducibility of such studies in the future.

Classification of Parkinson's disease with and without dopaminergic deficiency based on non-motor symptoms and structural neuroimaging.	The presence of non-motor symptoms (NMS) such as olfactive deficit or neuropsychiatric symptoms has been associated with the diagnosis of Parkinson's Disease (PD). NMS are also associated with different brain structural features underlying distinctive processes in PD. NMS has been poorly studied in patients with a PD-like clinical profile, showing Scans Without Evidence of Dopaminergic Deficit (SWEDD). This study proposes to compare classification models differentiating PD, SWEDD and Healthy Controls (HC) based on NMS and neurostructural factors. 683 participants (382 PD diagnosed in the last 2 years, 48 with SWEDD, 170 HC) from the PPMI dataset were compared based on available assessments. Each participant underwent an olfactive, neuropsychiatric and sleep assessment, and a 3T MRI. Brain volumes were extracted and standardized from each MRI. Classifications were based on logistic regressions using 5-fold cross-validation models combining different NMS and MRI data and determining their involvement in differentiation between patient subgroups (PD vs. SWEDD) or between patients and HC. NMS were significant factors in PD vs. SWEDD, PD vs. HC and SWEDD vs. HC classifiers, when considered alone or in combination with MRI data. No classification models were significantly different from chance based-on MRI, nor more accurate combining NMS and MRI when compared with models based on NMS only. These results highlight the importance of NMS in differentiating between PD and SWEDD, PD and HC, SWEDD and HC. However, classical imaging data such as cortical and subcortical volumetry seems insufficient to improve these classifications. Other imaging features such as connectivity could also be studied.

Identification of Parkinson's disease using MRI and genetic data from the PPMI cohort: an improved machine learning fusion approach.	OBJECTIVE: This study aim to leverage advanced machine learning techniques to develop and validate novel MRI imaging features and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) gene data fusion methodologies to enhance the early identification and diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD). METHODS: We leveraged a comprehensive dataset from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI), which includes high-resolution neuroimaging data, genetic single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) profiles, and detailed clinical information from individuals with early-stage PD and healthy controls. Two multi-modal fusion strategies were used: feature-level fusion, where we employed a hybrid feature selection algorithm combining Fisher discriminant analysis, an ensemble Lasso (EnLasso) method, and partial least squares (PLS) regression to identify and integrate the most informative features from neuroimaging and genetic data; and decision-level fusion, where we developed an adaptive ensemble stacking (AE_Stacking) model to synergistically integrate the predictions from multiple base classifiers trained on individual modalities. RESULTS: The AE_Stacking model achieving the highest average balanced accuracy of 95.36% and an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.974, significantly outperforming feature-level fusion and single-modal models ( CONCLUSION: The AE_Stacking model, trained on MRI and genetic data, demonstrates potential in distinguishing individuals with PD. Our findings enhance understanding of the disease and advance us toward the goal of precision medicine for neurodegenerative disorder.

Radiomics-based Modelling Unveils Cerebellar Involvement in Parkinson's Disease.	Emerging pathological and neurophysiological evidence has highlighted the cerebellum's involvement in Parkinson's disease (PD). This study aimed to explore the potential of cerebellum-derived magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) radiomics in distinguishing PD patients from healthy controls (HC). A retrospective analysis was conducted using three-dimensional-T1 MRI data (n= 374) from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) dataset (n= 204) and an independent in-house cohort (n= 170). Radiomic features (n= 883) were extracted from the cerebellar gray and white matter of each individual. Three machine learning models were developed: a cerebellar gray matter model, a cerebellar white matter model, and a combined gray and white matter model, to classify PD patients and HC. The results showed that the cerebellar gray matter model achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) of 0.931 in the training set, with a sensitivity of 60.8% and specificity of 97.1%, while in the testing set, it obtained an AUC of 0.874, with a sensitivity of 86.1% and specificity of 62.6%. The white matter-based model demonstrated an AUC of 0.846 (sensitivity, 59.8%; specificity, 87.3%) in the training set and an AUC of 0.868 (sensitivity, 81.0%; specificity, 75.8%) in the testing set. Notably, the combined gray and white matter model exhibited superior performance, achieving an AUC of 0.936 (sensitivity, 65.7%; specificity, 96.1%) in the training set and an AUC of 0.881 (sensitivity, 82.3%; specificity, 63.7%) in the testing set. Key radiomic features contributing to PD classification included Gray-level Dependence Matrix, Gray-level Co-occurrence Matrix and First-Order from gray matter, as well as Gray-level Size Zone Matrix from white matter, highlighting significant radiomics changes in the cerebellum associated with PD. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that MRI radiomics of cerebellar gray and white matter can effectively differentiate PD patients from HC, supporting the cerebellum's pivotal role in PD pathology and its potential as an imaging biomarker for PD.

Individualized diagnosis of Parkinson's disease based on multivariate magnetic resonance imaging radiomics and clinical indexes.	OBJECTIVE: To explore MRI-based radiomics models, integrating clinical characteristics, for differential diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD) to evaluate their diagnostic performance. METHODS: A total of 256 participants [153 PD, 103 healthy controls (HCs)] from the First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical Hospital, were enrolled as the training set, and 120 subjects (74 PD, 46 HCs) from the PPMI dataset served as the test set. Radiomics features were extracted from structural MRI (T1WI and T2-FLair). Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers were developed using MRI radiomics data from both monomodal and multimodal radiomics models. The clinical-radiomics model was constructed by integrating clinical variables, including UPDRS, Hoehn-Yahr stage, age, sex, and MMSE scores. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated to evaluate the performance of the models. Decision curve analysis (DCA) was performed to access the clinical usefulness of the models. RESULTS: In the training set, the T2-FLair and T1WI radiomics model achieved an AUC of 0.896 (95% CI, 0.812-0.900) and 0.899 (95% CI, 0.818-0.908), respectively. The double-sequence radiomics model demonstrated superior diagnostic performance, with an AUC of 0.965 (95% CI, 0.885-0.978) in the training set and an AUC of 0.852 (95% CI, 0.748-0.910) in the test set. The integrated clinical-radiomics model showed enhanced diagnostic accuracy, with AUC = 0.983 (95% CI, 0.897-0.996) in the training set and AUC = 0.837 (95% CI, 0.786-0.902) in the test set. Rad-scores derived from the radiomics model were significantly correlated with diagnostic outcomes ( CONCLUSION: The integrated clinical-radiomics model offered superior diagnostic performance compared to models based relying solely on imaging or clinical data, underscoring its potential as a non-invasive and effective tool in routine clinical practice for the early diagnosis of PD.

Identification of Depression Subtypes in Parkinson's Disease Patients via Structural MRI Whole-Brain Radiomics: An Unsupervised Machine Learning Study.	OBJECTIVE: Current clinical evaluation may tend to lack precision in detecting depression in Parkinson's disease (DPD). Radiomics features have gradually shown potential as auxiliary diagnostic tools in identifying and distinguishing different subtypes of Parkinson's disease (PD), and a radiomic approach that combines unsupervised machine learning has the potential to identify DPD. METHODS: Analyze the clinical and imaging data of 272 Parkinson's disease (PD) patients from the PPMI dataset, along with 45 PD patients from the NACC dataset. Extract radiomic features from T1-weighted MRI images and employ principal component analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction. Subsequently, apply four unsupervised clustering methods including Gaussian mixture model (GMM), hierarchical clustering, K-means, and partitioning around medoids (PAM) to classify cases in the PPMI dataset into distinct subtypes. Identify high-risk subtypes of DPD on the basis of the time and number of depression progression, and validate these findings using the NACC dataset. The data from the high-risk subtype were divided into a training subtype and a testing subtype in a 7:3 ratio. Multiple logistic regression analysis was conducted on the training subtype data to develop a traditional logistic regression model for the high-risk subtype, which was subsequently compared with a supervised logistic regression model constructed for the entire PPMI cohort. Finally, the performance of both models was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. In addition, a decision tree (DT) model was constructed based on independent risk factors of high-risk subtypes and validated using low-risk subtype data. ROC curves were employed to validate this model across training subtype, testing subtype, and low-risk subtype datasets. RESULTS: The PAM clustering method demonstrates superior performance compared to the other three clustering methods when the number of clusters is 2. High-risk subtypes of DPD can be effectively distinguished in both the PPMI and NACC datasets. A traditional logistic regression model was developed based on rapid-eye-movement behavior disorder, UPDRS I score, UPDRS II score, and ptau in high-risk subgroups. This model exhibits a diagnostic efficacy (AUC = 0.731) that surpasses that of the traditional regression model constructed using the entire PPMI cohort (AUC = 0.674). The prediction model based on high-risk subtypes had AUC values of 0.853 and 0.81 in the training and testing subtypes, sensitivities of 0.765 and 0.786, and specificities of 0.771 and 0.815, respectively. The AUC, sensitivity, and specificity in the nonhigh-risk subtype were 0.859, 0.654, and 0.852, respectively. CONCLUSION: By identifying MRI structural radiomics and clinical features as potential biomarkers, the radiomic approach and UCA provide new insights into the pathophysiology of DPD to support the clinical diagnosis with high prediction accuracy.

Iron deposition is associated with motor and non-motor network breakdown in parkinsonism.	BACKGROUND: Iron deposition has been observed in Parkinsonism and is emerging as a diagnostic marker for movement disorders. Brain functional network disruption has also been detected in parkinsonism, and is believed to be accountable for specific symptoms in parkinsonism. However, how iron deposition influences brain network remains to be elucidated. METHODS: We recruited 16 Parkinson's disease (PD), 8 multiple system atrophy (MSA) and 7 progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) patients. T1-weighted, susceptibility weighted images and resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) were acquired. Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) analysis was performed to quantify iron deposition in substantia nigra, putamen and dentate nucleus. Cerebellar network, sensorimotor network, default mode network and language networks were segregated using independent analysis. Network and iron deposition status were evaluated in relation to diagnostic groups, motor and non-motor symptoms. The relationship between quantitative iron deposition and brain network status was further interrogated. To further validate the findings, 13 healthy controls and 37 PD patients who had available T1 and rs-fMRI scans were selected from Parkinson's progression markers initiative (PPMI) database, and network analysis was performed. RESULTS: In local cohort, compared to PD, MSA patients showed greater iron deposition in putamen, while PSP patients had greater iron deposition in caudate nucleus and thalamus. Cerebellar and language networks showed significant difference across diagnostic groups, while default mode network and sensorimotor network did not. MSA patients had significantly impaired cerebellar network and language networks compared to PD patients. Cerebellar network was positively associated with motor symptom scores while language network was positively associated with MoCA scores in the patients. Iron deposition was negatively associated with both networks' activity in the patients. In PPMI cohort, impairment was found in both cerebellar and language networks in PD. Cerebellar and language networks correlated with motor and cognitive impairment, respectively. CONCLUSION: Cerebellar network and language networks are differently influenced in MSA, PD and PSP, which can serve as potential diagnostic marker. Impairment of cerebellar network and language network are associated with motor symptoms and cognitive impairment, respectively. Moreover, dysfunction of the networks is associated with iron deposition in deep nuclei (SN, DN, Putamen).

Domain-Specific Prediction of Clinical Progression in Parkinson's Disease Using the Mosaic Approach.	"PURPOSE: Due to the highly individualized clinical manifestation of Parkinson's disease (PD), personalized patient care may require domain-specific assessment of neurological disability. Evidence from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies has proposed that heterogenous clinical manifestation corresponds to heterogeneous cortical disease burden, suggesting customized, high-resolution assessment of cortical pathology as a candidate biomarker for domain-specific assessment. METHOD: Herein, we investigate the potential of the recently proposed Mosaic Approach (MAP), a normative framework for quantifying individual cortical disease burden with respect to a population-representative cohort, in predicting domain-specific clinical progression. Using MRI and clinical data from 135 recently diagnosed PD patients from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative, we first defined an extremity-specific motor score. We then identified cortical regions corresponding to ""extremity functions"" and restricted MAP, respectively, and contrasted the explanatory power of the extremity-specific MAP to unrestricted MAP. As control conditions, domain-related but less specific general motor function and nondomain-specific cognitive scores were considered. We also tested the predictive power of the restricted MAP in predicting disease progression over 1 and 3 years using support vector machines. The restricted, extremity-specific MAP yielded higher explanatory power for extremity-specific motor function at baseline as opposed to the unrestricted, whole-brain MAP. On the contrary, for general motor function, the unrestricted, whole-brain MAP yielded higher power. FINDING: No associations were found for cognitive function. The extremity-specific MAP predicted extremity-specific motor progression over 1 and 3 years above chance level. The MAP framework allows for domain-specific prediction of customized PD disease progression, which can inform machine learning, thereby contributing to personalized PD patient care."

Brain age in genetic and idiopathic Parkinson's disease.	The brain-age gap, i.e. the difference between the brain age estimated from structural MRI data and the chronological age of an individual, has been proposed as a summary measure of brain integrity in neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we aimed to determine the brain-age gap in genetic and idiopathic Parkinson's disease and its association with surrogate markers of Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease pathology and with rates of cognitive and motor function decline. We studied 1200 cases from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative cohort, including idiopathic Parkinson's disease, asymptomatic and clinical mutation carriers in the leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 gene (LRRK2) and the glucocerebrosidase gene (GBA), and normal controls using a cohort study design. For comparison, we studied 187 Alzheimer's disease dementia cases and 254 controls from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative cohort. We used Bayesian ANOVA to determine associations of the brain-age gap with diagnosis, and baseline measures of motor and cognitive function, dopamine transporter activity and CSF markers of Alzheimer's disease type amyloid-β42 and phosphotau pathology. Associations of brain-age gap with rates of cognitive and motor function decline were determined using Bayesian generalized mixed effect models. The brain-age gap in idiopathic Parkinson's disease patients was 0.7 years compared to controls, but 5.9 years in Alzheimer's disease dementia cases. In contrast, asymptomatic LRRK2 individuals had a 1.1. year younger brain age than controls. Across all cases, the brain-age gap was associated with motor impairment and (in the clinically manifest PD cases) reduced dopamine transporter activity, but less with CSF amyloid-β42 and phosphotau. In idiopathic Parkinson's disease cases, however, the brain-age gap was associated with lower CSF amyloid-β42 levels. In sporadic and genetic Parkinson's disease cases, a higher brain-age gap was associated with faster decline in episodic memory, and executive and motor function, whereas in asymptomatic LRRK2 cases, a smaller brain-age gap was associated with faster cognitive decline. In conclusion, brain age was sensitive to Alzheimer's disease like rather than Parkinson's disease like brain atrophy. Once an individual had idiopathic Parkinson's disease, their brain age was associated with markers of Alzheimer's disease rather than Parkinson's disease. Asymptomatic LRRK2 cases had seemingly younger brains than controls, and in these cases, younger brain age was associated with poorer cognitive outcome. This suggests that the term brain age is misleading when applied to disease stages where reactive brain changes with apparent volume increases rather than atrophy may drive the calculation of the brain age.

A survey of detection of Parkinson's disease using artificial intelligence models with multiple modalities and various data preprocessing techniques.	Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative brain disorder that causes symptoms such as tremors, sleeplessness, behavioral problems, sensory abnormalities, and impaired mobility, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Artificial intelligence, machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) have been used in recent studies (2015-2023) to improve PD diagnosis by categorizing patients and healthy controls based on similar clinical presentations. This study investigates several datasets, modalities, and data preprocessing techniques from the collected data. Issues are also addressed, with suggestions for future PD research involving subgrouping and connection analysis using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), dopamine transporter scan (DaTscan), and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) data. We have used different models like Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) for detecting PD at an early stage. We have used the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) dataset 3D brain images and archived the 86.67%, 94.02%, accuracy of models, respectively.

Cortical complexity alterations in motor subtypes of Parkinson's disease: A surface-based morphometry analysis of fractal dimension.	Based on motor symptoms, Parkinson's disease (PD) can be classified into tremor dominant (TD) and postural instability gait difficulty (PIGD) subtypes. Few studies have examined cortical complexity differences in PD motor subtypes. This study aimed to investigate differences in cortical complexity and grey matter volume (GMV) between TD and PIGD. We enrolled 36 TD patients, 27 PIGD patients and 66 healthy controls (HC) from the PPMI (Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative) database. Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and surface-based morphometry (SBM) were utilized to assess differences in GMV, cortical thickness and cortical complexity. The structural MRI data of participants was analysed using CAT12/SPM12 (p < 0.05, FDR corrected). Additionally, correlations between clinical data and structural changes were examined (p < 0.05, Holm-Bonferroni corrected). In comparison to both HC and TD groups, PIGD patients exhibited a significant fractal dimension (FD) decrease in many cortical regions. A significant negative correlation between age and FD was observed in the left insula for the PIGD patients and in the bilateral insula for the TD patients. However, no significant differences were found in GMV, cortical thickness or other complexity indices. Altered FD in the bilateral insula indicates that postural instability and gait disturbances may result from a failure to integrate information from various structures, whereas parkinsonian rest tremor is not associated with this integration. Also, widespread decreases in cortical FD demonstrate that FD is more sensitive than other complexity measures and can serve as a novel biomarker for identifying subtle changes in cortical morphology in the PIGD subtype.

RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: To investigate the impact of sleep disorders on glymphatic system in Parkinson's disease (PD) using a non-invasive imaging technique called diffusion tensor image analysis along perivascular space (DTI-ALPS). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 114 PD patients and 54 healthy controls (HCs) underwent sleep questionnaires and MRI examinations as part of data collection from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative cohort. An automated pipeline was proposed for ALPS calculation to reduce biases from manually region delineation. ALPS indices were compared between PD and HCs, as well as between PD with and without sleep disorders. Correlation was assessed between ALPS index and clinical characteristics. Furthermore, a 2-year follow-up analysis was performed to explore longitudinal impact of sleep disorders on glymphatic function. RESULTS: PD patients showed significantly decreased ALPS indices compared with HCs (P = 0.038). PD patients with sleep disorders showed slightly but not significantly decreased ALPS index compared with those with normal sleep (P = 0.058). However, PD patients who transitioned from normal sleep to sleep disorders showed significantly decreased ALPS index at follow-up compared to baseline (P = 0.047). In contrast, patients who maintained normal sleep showed no significant difference in ALPS index between follow-up and baseline (P = 0.934). In addition, PD patients who transitioned from normal sleep to sleep disorders showed significantly increased ΔMDS-UPDRS Part I score (P = 0.004), ΔMDS-UPDRS total score (P = 0.040) and ΔSCOPA-AUT (P = 0.048) compared with PD who remained normal sleep. CONCLUSION: Sleep disorders accelerate dysfunction of glymphatic system as indicated by ALPS index in PD patients, which may be associated with symptom progression in follow-up analysis. Therefore, more attention should be devoted to prevent sleep disorders in early PD.

Personalized progression modelling and prediction in Parkinson's disease with a novel multi-modal graph approach.	Parkinson's disease (PD) is a complex neurological disorder characterized by dopaminergic neuron degeneration, leading to diverse motor and non-motor impairments. This variability complicates accurate progression modelling and early-stage prediction. Traditional classification methods based on clinical symptoms are often limited by disease heterogeneity. This study introduces an graph-based interpretable personalized progression method, utilizing data from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) and Stroke Parkinson's Disease Biomarker Program (PDBP). Our approach integrates multimodal inter-individual and intra-individual data, including clinical assessments, MRI, and genetic information to make multi-dimension predictions. Validated using the PDBP dataset from 12 to 36 months, our AdaMedGraph method demonstrated strong performance, achieving AUC values of 0.748 and 0.714 for the 12-month Hoehn and Yahr Scale and Movement Disorder Society-Sponsored Revision of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) III on the PPMI test set. Ablation analysis reveals the importance of baseline clinical assessment predictors. This novel framework improves personalized care and offers insights into unique disease trajectories in PD patients.

Enhancement and evaluation for deep learning-based classification of volumetric neuroimaging with 3D-to-2D knowledge distillation.	The application of deep learning techniques for the analysis of neuroimaging has been increasing recently. The 3D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) technology, which is commonly adopted to encode volumetric information, requires a large number of datasets. However, due to the nature of the medical domain, there are limitations in the number of data available. This is because the cost of acquiring imaging is expensive and the use of personnel to annotate diagnostic labels is resource-intensive. For these reasons, several prior studies have opted to use comparatively lighter 2D CNNs instead of the complex 3D CNN technology. They analyze using projected 2D datasets created from representative slices extracted from 3D volumetric imaging. However, this approach, by selecting only projected 2D slices from the entire volume, reflects only partial volumetric information. This poses a risk of developing lesion diagnosis systems without a deep understanding of the interrelations among volumetric data. We propose a novel 3D-to-2D knowledge distillation framework that utilizes not only the projected 2D dataset but also the original 3D volumetric imaging dataset. This framework is designed to employ volumetric prior knowledge in training 2D CNNs. Our proposed method includes three modules: (i) a 3D teacher network that encodes volumetric prior knowledge from the 3D dataset, (ii) a 2D student network that encodes partial volumetric information from the 2D dataset, and aims to develop an understanding of the original volumetric imaging, and (iii) a distillation loss introduced to reduce the gap in the graph representation expressing the relationship between data in the feature embedding spaces of (i) and (ii), thereby enhancing the final performance. The effectiveness of our proposed method is demonstrated by improving the classification performance orthogonally across various 2D projection methods on two datasets from the 123I-DaTscan SPECT and 18 F-AV133 PET from Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI). Notably, when our approach is applied to the FuseMe approach, it achieves an F1 score of 98.30%, which is higher than that of the 3D teacher network (97.66%).

Enhancing MRI radiomics feature reproducibility and classification performance in Parkinson's disease: a harmonization approach to gray-level discretization variability.	OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the reproducibility of MRI-derived radiomic features across multiple gray-level discretization levels for classifying Parkinson's disease (PD) subtypes, and to evaluate the impact of ComBat harmonization on feature stability and machine learning performance. METHODS: T1-weighted MRI scans from 140 PD patients (70 tremor-dominant, 70 postural instability gait difficulty) and 70 healthy controls were obtained from the Parkinson's progression markers initiative (PPMI) database. Radiomic features were extracted from 16 brain regions using 6 discretization levels (8, 16, 32, 64, 128, and 256 bins). ComBat harmonization was applied using a combined batch variable incorporating both scanner models and discretization levels. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) and Kruskal-Wallis tests assessed feature reproducibility before and after harmonization. Support vector machine classifiers were used for PD subtype classification. RESULTS: ComBat harmonization significantly improved feature reproducibility across all feature groups. The percentage of features showing excellent robustness (ICC ≥ 0.90) increased substantially after harmonization. The proportion of features significantly affected by discretization levels was reduced following harmonization. Classification accuracy improved dramatically, from a range of 0.42-0.49 before harmonization to 0.86-0.96 after harmonization across most discretization levels. AUC values similarly increased from 0.60-0.67 to 0.93-0.99 after harmonization. CONCLUSIONS: ComBat harmonization significantly enhanced the reproducibility of radiomic features across discretization levels and improved PD subtype classification performance. This study highlights the importance of harmonization in radiomics research for PD and suggests potential clinical applications in personalized treatment planning.

Parkinson's Disease Mild Cognitive Impairment with MRI evidence of Cholinergic Nucleus 4 Degeneration: A New Subtype?	Subtyping Parkinson's disease with mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) could improve clinical trial design and personalized treatments. Cholinergic nucleus 4 (Ch4) volume has been linked to cognitive impairment severity and future decline in PD. This study investigates whether PD-MCI patients with MRI evidence of Ch4 degeneration have distinct clinical profiles and cognitive trajectories. Baseline MRI scans of 148 PD-MCI participants from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) were analyzed. Patients with low Ch4 grey matter density (GMD) had worse motor, autonomic, and olfactory symptoms, and were more likely to belong to the diffuse malignant PD subtype (51.6% vs. 23.4%; P < 0.01). They also had faster progression to cognitive milestones (P = 0.0046). These findings identify PD-MCI with low Ch4 as a distinct subtype with more severe symptoms and faster cognitive decline, highlighting the importance of considering this group in PD-MCI clinical trials, particularly for cholinergic therapies.

Prediction, prognosis and monitoring of neurodegeneration at biobank-scale via machine learning and imaging.	BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) are the most common neurodegenerative conditions. These central nervous system disorders impact both the structure and function of the brain and may lead to imaging changes that precede symptoms. Patients with ADRD or PD have long asymptomatic phases that exhibit significant heterogeneity. Hence, quantitative measures that can provide early disease indicators are necessary to improve patient stratification, clinical care, and clinical trial design. This work uses machine learning techniques to derive such a quantitative marker from T1-weighted (T1w) brain Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). METHODS: In this retrospective study, we developed machine learning (ML) based disease-specific scores based on T1w brain MRI utilizing Parkinson's Disease Progression Marker Initiative (PPMI) and Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohorts. We evaluated the potential of ML-based scores for early diagnosis, prognosis, and monitoring of ADRD and PD in an independent large-scale population-based longitudinal cohort, UK Biobank. FINDINGS: 1,826 dementia images from 731 participants, 3,161 healthy control images from 925 participants from the ADNI cohort, 684 PD images from 319 participants, and 232 healthy control images from 145 participants from the PPMI cohort were used to train machine learning models. The classification performance is 0.94 [95% CI: 0.93-0.96] area under the ROC Curve (AUC) for ADRD detection and 0.63 [95% CI: 0.57-0.71] for PD detection using 790 extracted structural brain features. The most predictive regions include the hippocampus and temporal brain regions in ADRD and the substantia nigra in PD. The normalized ML model's probabilistic output (ADRD and PD imaging scores) was evaluated on 42,835 participants with imaging data from the UK Biobank. There are 66 cases for ADRD and 40 PD cases whose T1 brain MRI is available during pre-diagnostic phases. For diagnosis occurrence events within 5 years, the integrated survival model achieves a time-dependent AUC of 0.86 [95% CI: 0.80-0.92] for dementia and 0.89 [95% CI: 0.85-0.94] for PD. ADRD imaging score is strongly associated with dementia-free survival (hazard ratio (HR) 1.76 [95% CI: 1.50-2.05] per S.D. of imaging score), and PD imaging score shows association with PD-free survival (hazard ratio 2.33 [95% CI: 1.55-3.50]) in our integrated model. HR and prevalence increased stepwise over imaging score quartiles for PD, demonstrating heterogeneity. As a proxy for diagnosis, we validated AD/PD polygenic risk scores of 42,835 subjects against the imaging scores, showing a highly significant association after adjusting for covariates. In both the PPMI and ADNI cohorts, the scores are associated with clinical assessments, including the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog), and pathological markers, which include amyloid and tau. Finally, imaging scores are associated with polygenic risk scores for multiple diseases. Our results suggest that we can use imaging scores to assess the genetic architecture of such disorders in the future. INTERPRETATION: Our study demonstrates the use of quantitative markers generated using machine learning techniques for ADRD and PD. We show that disease probability scores obtained from brain structural features are useful for early detection, prognosis prediction, and monitoring disease progression.

Impact of Harmonization on MRI Radiomics Feature Variability Across Preprocessing Methods for Parkinson's Disease Motor Subtype Classification.	This study aimed to assess the reproducibility of MRI-derived radiomic features across multiple preprocessing methods for classifying Parkinson's disease (PD) motor subtypes and to evaluate the impact of ComBat harmonization on feature stability and machine learning performance. T1-weighted MRI scans from 140 PD patients (70 tremor-dominant and 70 postural instability gait difficulty) and 70 healthy controls were obtained from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) database, acquired using different scanner models. Radiomic features were extracted from 16 brain regions using various preprocessing pipelines. ComBat harmonization was applied using a combined batch variable incorporating both scanner models and preprocessing methods. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) and Kruskal-Wallis tests assessed feature reproducibility before and after harmonization. Feature selection was performed using Linear Support Vector Classifier with L1 regularization. Support vector machine classifiers were used for PD subtype classification. ComBat harmonization significantly improved feature reproducibility across all feature groups. The percentage of features showing excellent robustness (ICC ≥ 0.90) increased from 40.2 to 56.3% after harmonization. First-order statistic features showed the highest robustness, with 71.11% demonstrating excellent ICC after harmonization. The proportion of features significantly affected by preprocessing methods was reduced following harmonization. Classification accuracy improved dramatically, from a range of 34-75% before harmonization to 89-96% after harmonization across all preprocessing methods. AUC values similarly increased from 0.28-0.87 to 0.95-0.99 after harmonization. ComBat harmonization significantly enhanced the reproducibility of radiomic features across preprocessing methods and improved PD motor subtype classification performance.

An Automated Diagnosis of Parkinson's Disease from MRI Scans Based on Enhanced Residual Dense Network with Attention Mechanism.	The increasing prevalence of neurodegenerative diseases has recently heightened interest in research on early diagnosis of these diseases. Parkinson's disease (PD), among the most prominent of these conditions, is a neurological disorder causing the loss of nerve cells and significantly affecting movement control. Detection of PD in early stages is of critical importance to prevent the progression of the disease and improve treatment processes. The aim of the current study is to develop a deep learning model that can perform accurate classification for early diagnosis of PD from MRI images. In this study, a densely connected feature fusion network with residual learning is designed to diagnose PD patients. The designed network consists of a serial dense block with skip connections and efficient attention mechanisms. In this architecture, squeeze-excitation (SE) blocks with ResNeXt (SE-ResNeXt block) modules are utilized to extract distinctive and high-level features. In the experiments, a publicly available T2-weighted MRI dataset is used, and an offline augmentation process is applied to limited data to increase the generalization ability and classification performance. The proposed method is evaluated and compared with current state-of-the-art deep learning methods. The obtained results show that the proposed model gives higher classification performance with an overall accuracy of 94.44%, precision of 91.67%, sensitivity of 91.67%, specificity of 95.83%, F1-score of 91.67%, and Matthew's correlation coefficient of 87.50% for the PD and healthy control subjects.

Temporal ordering of cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease patients based on disease progression models.	INTRODUCTION: Identifying Parkinson's disease (PD) patients at risk of cognitive decline is crucial for enhancing clinical interventions. While several models predicting cognitive decline in PD exist, a new machine learning framework called disease progression models (DPMs) offers a data-driven approach to understand disease evolution. METHODS: We enrolled 423 PD patients and 196 healthy controls from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI). Our study encompassed a range of biomarkers, including motor, neurocognitive, and neuroimaging evaluations at baseline and annually. A methodology was employed to select optimal combinations of biomarkers for constructing DPMs with superior predictive capabilities for both diagnosing and estimating conversion times toward cognitive decline. RESULTS: At baseline, the approach showed excellent performance in identifying individuals at high risk of cognitive decline within the first five years. Furthermore, the proposed timeline from cognitive impairment to dementia was also used to explore clinical events such as the onset of cognitive impairment, the development of dementia or amyloid pathology. The presence of amyloid pathology did not alter the progression of cognitive impairment among PD patients.

BACKGROUND: Previous research revealed differences in cerebellar white matter integrity by disease stages, indicating a compensatory role in Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the temporal evolution of cerebellar white matter microstructure in patients with PD (PwPD) remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: To unravel temporal evolution of cerebellar white matter and its dopaminergic correlates in PD. METHODS: We recruited 124 PwPD from the PPMI study. The participants were divided into two subsets: Subset 1 (n = 41) had three MRI scans (baseline, 2 years, and 4 years), and Subset 2 (n = 106) had at least two MRI scans at baseline, 1 year, and/or 2 years. Free water-corrected diffusion metrics were used to measure the microstructural integrity in cerebellar peduncles (CP), the main white matter tracts connecting to and from the cerebellum. The ACAPULCO processing pipeline was used to assess cerebellar lobules volumes. Linear mixed-effect models were used to study longitudinal changes. We also examined the relationships between microstructural integrity in CP, striatal dopamine transporter specific binding ratio (SBR), and clinical symptoms. RESULTS: Microstructural changes in CP showed a non-linear pattern in PwPD. Free water-corrected fractional anisotropy (FAt) increased in the first two years but declined from 2 to 4 years, while free water-corrected mean diffusivity exhibited the opposite trend. The initial increased FAt in CP correlated with cerebellar regional volume atrophy, striatal dopaminergic SBR decline, and worsening clinical symptoms, but this correlation varied across disease stages. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest a non-linear evolution of microstructural integrity in CP throughout the course of PD, indicating the adaptive structural reorganization of the cerebellum simultaneously with progressive striatal dopaminergic degeneration in PD.

Surface-Based Morphometry Analysis of the Cerebral Cortex in Patients With Probable Idiopathic Rapid Eye Movement Sleep Behavior Disorder.	INTRODUCTION: Strong indications support the notion that idiopathic rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (iRBD) acts as a precursor to multiple α-synucleinopathies, including Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies. Despite numerous investigations into the alterations in cortical thickness and the volume of subcortical areas associated with this condition, comprehensive studies on the cortical surface morphology, focusing on gyrification and sulcal depth changes, are scarce. The purpose of this research was to explore the cortical surface morphology in individuals with probable iRBD (piRBD), to pinpoint early-phase diagnostic markers. METHODS: This study included 30 piRBD patients confirmed using the RBD Screening Questionnaire (RBDSQ) and 33 control individuals selected from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) database. They underwent neurophysiological tests and MRI scans. The FreeSurfer software was utilized to estimate cortical thickness (CTH), cortical and subcortical volumetry, local gyrification index (LGI), and sulcus depth (SD). Subsequently, these parameters were compared between the two groups. Additionally, linear correlation analysis was employed to estimate the relationship between brain morphological parameters and clinical parameters. RESULTS: Compared to the healthy control (HC), piRBD patients exhibited a significant reduction in CTH, LGI, and cortical volume in the bilateral superior parietal, lateral occipital, orbitofrontal, temporo-occipital, bilateral rostral middle frontal, inferior parietal, and precentral brain regions. Moreover, a significant and notable correlation was observed between CTH and Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), letter-number sequencing (LTNS), the Benton Judgment of Line Orientation (BJLO) test, and the symbol digit modalities test (SDMT) in several brain regions encompassing the motor cortex. CONCLUSION: Patients with piRBD displayed widespread atrophy in various brain regions, predominantly covering the motor and sensory cortex. Furthermore, LGI could serve as a prognostic biomarker of disease's progression in piRBD.	cortical analysis; neurodegenerative diseases; probable idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (iRBD)

Sex-Specific Imaging Biomarkers for Parkinson's Disease Diagnosis: A Machine Learning Analysis.	This study aimed to identify sex-specific imaging biomarkers for Parkinson's disease (PD) based on multiple MRI morphological features by using machine learning methods. Participants were categorized into female and male subgroups, and various structural morphological features were extracted. An ensemble Lasso (EnLasso) method was employed to identify a stable optimal feature subset for each sex-based subgroup. Eight typical classifiers were adopted to construct classification models for PD and HC, respectively, to validate whether models specific to sex subgroups could bolster the precision of PD identification. Finally, statistical analysis and correlation tests were carried out on significant brain region features to identify potential sex-specific imaging biomarkers. The best model (MLP) based on the female subgroup and male subgroup achieved average classification accuracy of 92.83% and 92.11%, respectively, which were better than that of the model based on the overall samples (86.88%) and the overall model incorporating gender factor (87.52%). In addition, the most discriminative feature of PD among males was the lh 6r (FD), but among females, it was the lh PreS (GI). The findings indicate that the sex-specific PD diagnosis model yields a significantly higher classification performance compared to previous models that included all participants. Additionally, the male subgroup exhibited a greater number of brain region changes than the female subgroup, suggesting sex-specific differences in PD risk markers. This study underscore the importance of stratifying data by sex and offer insights into sex-specific variations in PD phenotypes, which could aid in the development of precise and personalized diagnostic approaches in the early stages of the disease.

An efficient ranking-based ensembled multiclassifier for neurodegenerative diseases classification using deep learning.	Neurodegenerative diseases are group of debilitating and progressive disorders that primarily affect the structure and functions of nervous system, leading to gradual loss of neurons and subsequent decline in cognitive, and behavioral activities. The two frequent diseases affecting the world's significant population falling in the above category are Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). These disorders substantially impact the quality of life and burden healthcare systems and society. The demographic characteristics, and machine learning approaches have now been employed to diagnose these illnesses; however, they possess accuracy limitations. Therefore, the authors have developed ranking-based ensemble approach based on the weighted strategy of deep learning classifiers. The whole modeling procedure of the proposed approach incorporates three phases. In phase I, preprocessing techniques are applied to clean the noise in datasets to make it standardized according to deep learning models as it significantly impacts their performance. In phase II, five deep learning models are selected for classification and calculation of prediction results. In phase III, a ranking-based ensemble approach is proposed to ensemble the results of the five models after calculating the ranks and weights of them. In addition, the Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) datasets named Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) for AD classification and Parkinson's Progressive Marker Initiative (PPMI) for PD classification are selected to validate the proposed approach. Furthermore, the proposed method achieved the classification accuracy on AD- Cognitive Normals (CN) at 97.89%, AD- Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) at 99.33% and CN-MCI at 99.44% and on PD-CN at 99.22%, PD- Scans Without Evidence of Dopaminergic Effect (SWEDD) at 97.56% and CN-SWEDD at 98.22% respectively. Also, the multi-class classification shows the promising accuracy of 97.18% for AD and 97.85% for PD for the proposed framework. The findings of the study show that the proposed deep learning-based ensemble technique is competitive for AD and PD prediction in both multiclass and binary class classification. Furthermore, the proposed approach enhances generalization performance in diagnosing neurodegenerative diseases and performs better than existing approaches.

Associations of Multimorbidity with Cerebrospinal Fluid Biomarkers for Neurodegenerative Disorders in Early Parkinson's Disease: A Crosssectional and Longitudinal Study.	OBJECT: The study aims to determine whether multimorbidity status is associated with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers for neurodegenerative disorders. METHODS: A total of 827 patients were enrolled from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) database, including 638 patients with early-stage Parkinson's disease (PD) and 189 healthy controls (HCs). Multimorbidity status was evaluated based on the count of long-term conditions (LTCs) and the multimorbidity pattern. Using linear regression models, cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses were conducted to assess the associations of multimorbidity status with CSF biomarkers for neurodegenerative disorders, including α-synuclein (αSyn), amyloid-β RESULTS: At baseline, the CSF t-tau (p = 0.010), p-tau (p = 0.034), and NfL (p = 0.049) levels showed significant differences across the three categories of LTC counts. In the longitudinal analysis, the presence of LTCs was associated with lower Aβ CONCLUSION: Multimorbidity, especially severe multimorbidity and the pattern of mental/musculoskeletal/ tumor disorders, was associated with CSF biomarkers for neurodegenerative disorders in early-stage PD patients, suggesting that multimorbidity might play a crucial role in aggravating neuronal damage in neurodegenerative diseases.

Increased mean diffusivity of the caudal motor SNc identifies patients with REM sleep behaviour disorder and Parkinson's disease.	Idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder (iRBD)-a Parkinson's disease (PD) prodrome-might exhibit neural changes similar to those in PD. Substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) degeneration underlies motor symptoms of PD. In iRBD and early PD (ePD), we measured diffusion MRI (dMRI) in the caudal motor SNc, which overlaps the nigrosome-1-the earliest-degenerating dopaminergic neurons in PD-and in the striatum. Nineteen iRBD, 26 ePD (1.7 ± 0.03 years), and 46 age-matched healthy controls (HCs) were scanned at Western University, and 47 iRBD, 115 ePD (0.9 ± 0.01 years), and 56 HCs were scanned through the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative, using 3T MRI. We segmented the SNc and striatum into subregions using automated probabilistic tractography to the cortex. We measured mean diffusivity (MD) and fractional anisotropy (FA) along white-matter bundles and subregional surfaces. We performed group-level and classification analyses. Increased caudal motor SNc surface MD was the only iRBD-HCs and ePD-HCs difference replicating across datasets (p

Neuroanatomical Signature of the Transition from Normal Cognition to MCI in Parkinson's Disease.	The progression of Parkinson's disease (PD) is often accompanied by cognitive decline. We had previously developed a brain age estimation program utilizing structural MRI data of 949 healthy individuals from publicly available sources. Structural MRI data of 244 PD patients who were cognitively normal at baseline was acquired from the Parkinson Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI). 192 of these showed stable normal cognitive function from baseline out to 5 years (PD-SNC), and the remaining 52 had unstable normal cognition and developed mild cognitive impairment within 5 years (PD-UNC). 105 healthy controls were also included in the analysis as a reference. First, we examined if there were any baseline differences in regional brain structure between PD-UNC and PD-SNC cohorts utilizing the three most widely used atrophy estimation pipelines, i.e., voxel-based morphometry (VBM), deformation-based morphometry and cortical thickness analyses. We then investigated if accelerated brain age estimation with our multivariate regressive machine learning algorithm was different across these groups (HC, PD-SNC, and PD-UNC). As per the VBM analysis, PD-UNC patients demonstrated a noticeable increase in GM volume in the posterior and anterior lobes of the cerebellum, sub-lobar, extra-nuclear, thalamus, and pulvinar regions when compared to PD-SNC at baseline. PD-UNC patients were observed to have significantly older brain age compared to both PD-SNC patients (p=0.009) and healthy controls (p<0.009). The increase in GM volume in the PD-UNC group could potentially indicate an inflammatory or neuronal hypertrophy response, which could serve as a biomarker for future cognitive decline among this population.

Unlocking the potential: T1-weighed MRI as a powerful predictor of levodopa response in Parkinson's disease.	BACKGROUND: The efficacy of levodopa, the most crucial metric for Parkinson's disease diagnosis and treatment, is traditionally gauged through the levodopa challenge test, which lacks a predictive model. This study aims to probe the predictive power of T1-weighted MRI, the most accessible modality for levodopa response. METHODS: This retrospective study used two datasets: from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (219 records) and the external clinical dataset from Ruijin Hospital (217 records). A novel feature extraction method using MedicalNet, a pre-trained deep learning network, along with three previous approaches was applied. Three machine learning models were trained and tested on the PPMI dataset and included clinical features, imaging features, and their union set, using the area under the curve (AUC) as the metric. The most significant brain regions were visualized. The external clinical dataset was further evaluated using trained models. A paired one-tailed t-test was performed between the two sets; statistical significance was set at p < 0.001. RESULTS: For 46 test set records (mean age, 62 ± 9 years, 28 men), MedicalNet-extracted features demonstrated a consistent improvement in all three machine learning models (SVM 0.83 ± 0.01 versus 0.73 ± 0.01, XgBoost 0.80 ± 0.04 versus 0.74 ± 0.02, MLP 0.80 ± 0.03 versus 0.70 ± 0.07, p < 0.001). Both feature sets were validated on the clinical dataset using SVM, where MedicalNet features alone achieved an AUC of 0.64 ± 0.03. Key responsible brain regions were visualized. CONCLUSION: The T1-weighed MRI features were more robust and generalizable than the clinical features in prediction; their combination provided the best results. T1-weighed MRI provided insights on specific regions responsible for levodopa response prediction. CRITICAL RELEVANCE STATEMENT: This study demonstrated that T1w MRI features extracted by a deep learning model have the potential to predict the levodopa response of PD patients and are more robust than widely used clinical information, which might help in determining treatment strategy. KEY POINTS: This study investigated the predictive value of T1w features for levodopa response. MedicalNet extractor outperformed all other previously published methods with key region visualization. T1w features are more effective than clinical information in levodopa response prediction.	Levodopa response; Machine learning; Magnetic resonance imaging; Parkinson’s disease

Parkinson's Disease Recognition Using Decorrelated Convolutional Neural Networks: Addressing Imbalance and Scanner Bias in rs-fMRI Data.	Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative and progressive disease that impacts the nerve cells in the brain and varies from person to person. The exact cause of PD is still unknown, and the diagnosis of PD does not include a specific objective test with certainty. Although deep learning has made great progress in medical neuroimaging analysis, these methods are very susceptible to biases present in neuroimaging datasets. An innovative decorrelated deep learning technique is introduced to mitigate class bias and scanner bias while simultaneously focusing on finding distinguishing characteristics in resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) data, which assists in recognizing PD with good accuracy. The decorrelation function reduces the nonlinear correlation between features and bias in order to learn bias-invariant features. The publicly available Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) dataset, referred to as a single-scanner imbalanced dataset in this study, was used to validate our method. The imbalanced dataset problem affects the performance of the deep learning framework by overfitting to the majority class. To resolve this problem, we propose a new decorrelated convolutional neural network (DcCNN) framework by applying decorrelation-based optimization to convolutional neural networks (CNNs). An analysis of evaluation metrics comparisons shows that integrating the decorrelation function boosts the performance of PD recognition by removing class bias. Specifically, our DcCNN models perform significantly better than existing traditional approaches to tackle the imbalance problem. Finally, the same framework can be extended to create scanner-invariant features without significantly impacting the performance of a model. The obtained dataset is a multiscanner dataset, which leads to scanner bias due to the differences in acquisition protocols and scanners. The multiscanner dataset is a combination of two publicly available datasets, namely, PPMI and FTLDNI-the frontotemporal lobar degeneration neuroimaging initiative (NIFD) dataset. The results of t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) and scanner classification accuracy of our proposed feature extraction-DcCNN (FE-DcCNN) model validated the effective removal of scanner bias. Our method achieves an average accuracy of 77.80% on a multiscanner dataset for differentiating PD from a healthy control, which is superior to the DcCNN model trained on a single-scanner imbalanced dataset.

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate whether each type of sleep disturbances (i.e., pRBD, EDS, and insomnia) is specifically associated with faster decline in global cognition and different cognitive domains among de novo PD patients. We also assessed the influence of sleep disturbances on core AD CSF biomarkers alterations and conversion to dementia. METHODS: Prospectively longitudinal data were obtained from the PPMI cohort. Sleep disturbances and cognition ability were assessed by questionnaires at baseline and follow-up visits. Generalized linear mixed models were utilized to assess the effect of sleep disturbances on cognitive decline and core AD CSF biomarkers change. The associations between sleep disturbances and conversion to dementia were analyzed using Cox regression analysis. RESULTS: Baseline pRBD was associated with faster decline in global cognition and all cognitive domains, including verbal episodic memory, visuospatial ability, executive function, language, and processing speed. EDS was associated with faster decline in three cognitive domains, including verbal episodic memory, executive function/working memory, and processing speed. Insomnia was associated with faster decline in global cognition and verbal episodic memory. Meanwhile, pRBD and EDS were associated with longitudinal decrease of CSF Aβ42. Baseline pRBD increased the risk of conversion to dementia. The risk of dementia in PD patients with multiple sleep disturbances also increased compared with those without sleep disturbance. INTERPRETATION: Sleep disturbances (i.e., pRBD, EDS, and insomnia) were associated with cognitive decline in early PD. EDS and pRBD were associated with decrease of CSF Aβ42. Moreover, pRBD was associated with conversion to dementia.

Predicting the occurrence of mild cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease using structural MRI data.	INTRODUCTION: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a common symptom observed in individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD) and a main risk factor for progressing to dementia. Our objective was to identify early anatomical brain changes that precede the transition from healthy cognition to MCI in PD. METHODS: Structural T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging data of PD patients with healthy cognition at baseline were downloaded from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative database. Patients were divided into two groups based on the annual cognitive assessments over a 5-year time span: (i) PD patients with unstable healthy cognition who developed MCI over a 5-year follow-up (PD-UHC, RESULTS: The average accuracy of classifying PD-UHC vs. PD-SHC was 80.76%, with 82.05% sensitivity and 79.48% specificity using 10-fold cross-validation. The performance was similar in the hold-out test sets with all accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity at 76.92%. SHAP analysis showed that the most influential brain regions in the prediction model were located in the frontal, occipital, and cerebellar regions as well as midbrain. DISCUSSION: Our machine learning-based analysis yielded promising results in identifying PD individuals who are at risk of cognitive decline from the earliest disease stage and revealed the brain regions which may be linked to the prospective cognitive decline in PD before clinical symptoms emerge.

Longitudinal study investigating the influence of COMT gene polymorphism on cortical thickness changes in Parkinson's disease over four years.	Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder affecting over 3% of those over 65. It's caused by reduced dopaminergic neurons and Lewy bodies, leading to motor and non-motor symptoms. The relationship between COMT gene polymorphisms and PD is complex and not fully elucidated. Some studies have reported associations between certain COMT gene variants and PD risk, while others have not found significant associations. This study investigates how COMT gene variations impact cortical thickness changes in PD patients over time, aiming to link genetic factors, especially COMT gene variations, with PD progression. This study analyzed data from 44 PD patients with complete 4-year imaging follow-up from the Parkinson Progression Marker Initiative (PPMI) database. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were acquired using consistent methods across 9 different MRI scanners. COMT single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were assessed based on whole genome sequencing data. Longitudinal image analysis was conducted using FreeSurfer's processing pipeline. Linear mixed-effect models were employed to examine the interaction effect of genetic variations and time on cortical thickness, while controlling for covariates and subject-specific variations. The rs165599 SNP stands out as a potential contributor to alterations in cortical thickness, showing a significant reduction in overall mean cortical thickness in both hemispheres in homozygotes (Left: P = 0.023, Right: P = 0.028). The supramarginal, precentral, and superior frontal regions demonstrated significant bilateral alterations linked to rs165599. Our findings suggest that the rs165599 variant leads to earlier manifestation of cortical thinning during the course of the disease. However, it does not result in more severe cortical thinning outcomes over time. There is a need for larger cohorts and control groups to validate these findings and consider genetic variant interactions and clinical features to elucidate the specific mechanisms underlying COMT-related neurodegenerative processes in PD.

Longitudinal brain changes in Parkinson's disease with severe olfactory deficit.	INTRODUCTION: Olfactory dysfunction and REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) are associated with distinct cognitive trajectories in the course of Parkinson's disease (PD). The underlying neurobiology for this relationship remains unclear but may involve distinct patterns of neurodegeneration. This study aimed to examine longitudinal cortical atrophy and thinning in early-stage PD with severe olfactory deficit (anosmia) without and with concurrent probable RBD. METHODS: Longitudinal MRI data over four years of 134 de novo PD and 49 healthy controls (HC) from the Parkinson Progression Marker Initiative (PPMI) cohort were analyzed using a linear mixed-effects model. Patients were categorized into those with anosmia by the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT) score ≤ 18 (AO+) and those without (UPSIT score > 18, AO-). The AO+ group was further subdivided into AO+ with probable RBD (AO+RBD+) and without (AO+RBD-) for subanalysis. RESULTS: Compared to subjects without baseline anosmia, the AO+ group exhibited greater longitudinal declines in both volume and thickness in the bilateral parahippocampal gyri and right transverse temporal gyrus. Patients with concurrent anosmia and RBD showed more extensive longitudinal declines in cortical volume and thickness, involving additional brain regions including the bilateral precuneus, left inferior temporal gyrus, right paracentral gyrus, and right precentral gyrus. CONCLUSIONS: The atrophy/thinning patterns in early-stage PD with severe olfactory dysfunction include regions that are critical for cognitive function and could provide a structural basis for previously reported associations between severe olfactory deficit and cognitive decline in PD. Concurrent RBD might enhance the dynamics of cortical changes.	Cognitive impairment; MRI; Olfactory dysfunction; Parkinson's disease; REM sleep behavior disorder

BACKGROUND: Although apathy and impulse control disorders (ICDs) are considered to represent opposite extremes of a continuum of motivated behavior (i.e., hypo- and hyperdopaminergic behaviors), they may also co-occur in Parkinson's disease (PD). OBJECTIVES: We aimed to explore the co-occurrence of ICDs and apathy and its neural correlates analyzing gray matter (GM) changes in early untreated PD patients. Moreover, we aimed to investigate the possible longitudinal relationship between ICDs and apathy and their putative impact on cognition during the first five years of PD. METHODS: We used the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) database to identify the co-occurrence of apathy and ICDs in 423 early drug-naïve PD patients at baseline and at 5-year follow-up. Baseline MRI volumes and gray matter changes were analyzed between groups using voxel-based morphometry. Multi-level models assessed the longitudinal relationship (across five years) between apathy and ICDs and cognitive functioning. RESULTS: At baseline, co-occurrence of apathy and ICDs was observed in 23 patients (5.4%). This finding was related to anatomical GM reduction along the cortical regions involved in the limbic circuit and cognitive control systems. Longitudinal analyses indicated that apathy and ICDs were related to each other as well as to the combined use of levodopa and dopamine agonists. Worse apathetic and ICDs states were associated with poorer executive functions. CONCLUSIONS: Apathy and ICDs are joint non-exclusive neuropsychiatric disorders also in the early stages of PD and their co-occurrence was associated with GM decrease in several cortical regions of the limbic circuit and cognitive control systems.

Cortical gray matter and cerebral white matter atrophy and asymmetry in Parkinson's disease patients with normal cognitive precede.	BACKGROUND: Parkinson's disease is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder with complex and distributed motor and non-motor symptoms. In this study, cortical gray matter (GM) and cerebral white matter (WM) overall atrophy, and asymmetry of atrophy are investigated in PD with normal cognitive function. METHOD: Forty-eight male Parkinson's disease(PD) patients with normal cognitive precede (PD-NC), and thirty matched healthy control (HC) subjects were selected from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) database. Brain structures volumes were extracted using Freesurfer software based on subject 3 tesla MRI images. The normalized volume of cortical GM and cerebral WM were compared in two study groups, and then the asymmetry index (AI) of GM and WM atrophy was also assessed in two groups. Statistical analysis was constructed using a t-test with RESULTS: No significant difference was observed in the volume of cortical GM and cerebral WM in the two study groups. The cortical GM asymmetry index in the PD-NC group was significantly ( CONCLUSION: Atrophy in cortical GM and WM was not observed between the PD-NC and the HC group, however, the asymmetry index in GM was significant between the two group. It seems that the brain's bilateral balance has ruptured in PD. Cortical GM asymmetry in PD-NC can be considered a potent biomarker and should be investigated more in the future. In future studies, construction of a longitudinal study on this issue could be useful.	Parkinson’s disease; brain atrophy; brain lateralization; cerebral white matter; cortical gray matter

Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects over 10 million people worldwide. Brain atrophy and microstructural abnormalities tend to be more subtle in PD than in other age-related conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, so there is interest in how well machine learning methods can detect PD in radiological scans. Deep learning models based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can automatically distil diagnostically useful features from raw MRI scans, but most CNN-based deep learning models have only been tested on T1-weighted brain MRI. Here we examine the added value of diffusion-weighted MRI (dMRI) - a variant of MRI, sensitive to microstructural tissue properties - as an additional input in CNN-based models for PD classification. Our evaluations used data from 3 separate cohorts - from Chang Gung University, the University of Pennsylvania, and the PPMI dataset. We trained CNNs on various combinations of these cohorts to find the best predictive model. Although tests on more diverse data are warranted, deep-learned models from dMRI show promise for PD classification.Clinical Relevance- This study supports the use of diffusion-weighted images as an alternative to anatomical images for AI-based detection of Parkinson's disease.

Free water imaging unravels unique patterns of longitudinal structural brain changes in Parkinson's disease subtypes.	BACKGROUND: Research shows that individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD) who have a postural instability and gait difficulties (PIGD) subtype have a faster disease progression compared to those with a tremor dominant (TD) subtype. Nevertheless, our understanding of the structural brain changes contributing to these clinical differences remains limited, primarily because many brain imaging techniques are only capable of detecting changes in the later stages of the disease. OBJECTIVE: Free water (FW) has emerged as a robust progression marker in several studies, showing increased values in the posterior substantia nigra that predict symptom worsening. Here, we examined longitudinal FW changes in TD and PIGD across multiple brain regions. METHODS: Participants were TD and PIGD enrolled in the Parkinson's Progression Marker Initiative (PPMI) study who underwent diffusion MRI at baseline and 2 years later. FW changes were quantified for regions of interest (ROI) within the basal ganglia, thalamus, brainstem, and cerebellum. RESULTS: Baseline FW in all ROIs did not differ between groups. Over 2 years, PIGD had a greater percentage increase in FW in the putamen, globus pallidus, and cerebellar lobule V. A logistic regression model incorporating percent change in motor scores and FW in these brain regions achieved 91.4% accuracy in discriminating TD and PIGD, surpassing models based solely on clinical measures (74.3%) or imaging (76.1%). CONCLUSION: The results further suggest the use of FW to study disease progression in PD and provide insight into the differential course of brain changes in early-stage PD subtypes.

Cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers profile in scans without evidence of dopaminergic deficits (SWEDD).	BACKGROUND: A small proportion of patients with clinical parkinsonism have normal transporter-single photon emission computed tomography (DaTSPECT) which is commonly defined as scans without evidence of dopaminergic deficits (SWEDD). A better understanding of SWEDD can improve the current therapeutic options and appropriate disease monitoring. AIM: We aimed to assess CSF biomarkers levels including α-synuclein (α-syn), amyloid βeta (Aβ1-42), total tau (t-tau), and phosphorylated tau (p-tau) in SWEDD and investigate the longitudinal alteration in the CSF profile. METHODS: In total, 406 early-stage PD, 58 SWEDD, and 187 healthy controls (HCs) were entered into our study from PPMI. We compared the level of CSF biomarkers at baseline, six months, one year, and two years. Furthermore, the longitudinal alteration of CSF biomarkers was explored in each group using linear mixed models. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in the level of CSF α-syn Aβ1-42, t-tau, and p-tau between HCs and SWEDD at different time points. Investigating the level of CSF α-syn in PD and SWEDD showed a significant difference at one ( CONCLUSION: This finding suggests a faster neurodegeneration process in PD patients compared to SWEDD at least based on these biomarkers. Future studies with longer follow-up duration and more sample sizes are necessary to validate our results.

Baseline prevalence and longitudinal assessment of autonomic dysfunction in early Parkinson's disease.	Autonomic dysfunction (AutD) is common and debilitating in Parkinson's disease (PD). Predictors of AutD are unclear, and data are limited on the biological relevance of AutD in PD. Here, we evaluated the baseline prevalence and 2-year longitudinal assessment of AutD in patients with de novo PD compared with healthy controls (HC). Moreover, we also assessed various variables that could predict longitudinal changes in AutD in early PD. Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) was utilized to evaluate untreated PD participants at baseline and HC. Autonomic function was assessed using the 25-item Scale for Outcomes in Parkinson's Disease-Autonomic (SCOPA-AUT) score at baseline and 2 years. Clinical and biological variables were measured for their correlations with AuD for up to 2 years. Two hundred and ninety PD subjects and 170 HC were enrolled and followed for 2 years. SCOPA-AUT mean (SD) scores increased from baseline 8.49 ± 5.23 to 10.12 ± 5.77 at year 2 in PD subjects (p < 0.001) versus from 4.98 ± 3.34 to 5.03 ± 374 in HC (p = 0.496), with a significant difference between the groups (p < 0.001). Among them, 242 PD participants and 151 HC completed the SCOPA-AUT assessment, including sexual function. In the multivariate analysis, a higher baseline SCOPA-AUT score was associated with higher baseline MDS-UPDRS Part I scores (p < 0.001). Moreover, a longitudinal increase in autonomic function severity was associated with the white race (p = 0.010) at baseline. In contrast, there was no association with the CSF biomarkers. MDS-UPDRS Part I score may predict AuD in patients with early PD, which is correlated with nonmotor symptoms and race.	Autonomic dysfunction; Biomarkers; PPMI; Parkinson’s disease; SCOPA-AUT

Magnetic Resonance Imaging Biomarkers of Punding in Parkinson's Disease.	Punding is a rare condition triggered by dopaminergic therapy in Parkinson's disease (PD), characterized by a complex, excessive, repetitive, and purposeless abnormal movement, and its pathogenesis remains unclear. We aimed to assess the brain structure alterations related to punding by using multipametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Thirty-eight PD patients (19 with punding and 19 without punding) from the Parkinson's Progression Marker Initiative (PPMI) were included in this study. Cortical thickness was assessed with FreeSurfer, and the integrity of white matter fiber tracts and network topologies were analyzed by using FMRIB Software Library (FSL) and Pipeline for Analyzing braiN Diffusion imAges (PANDA). PD patients with punding showed a higher apathy score and more severe cortical atrophy in the left superior parietal, right inferior parietal, and right superior frontal gyrus, and worse integrity of the right cingulum cingulate tract compared to those without punding. On the other hand, no significant difference in structural network topologies was detected between the two groups. These data suggest that the specific area of destruction may be an MRI biomarker of punding risk, and these findings may have important implications for understanding the neural mechanisms of punding in PD.

MRI-based multivariate gray matter volumetric distance for predicting motor symptom progression in Parkinson's disease.	While Parkinson's disease (PD)-related neurodegeneration is associated with structural changes in the brain, conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has proven less effective for clinical diagnosis due to its inability to reliably identify subtle changes early in the disease course. In this study, we aimed to develop a structural MRI-based biomarker to predict the rate of progression of motor symptoms in the early stages of PD. The study included 88 patients with PD and 120 healthy controls from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative database; MRI at baseline and motor symptom scores assessed using the MDS-UPDRS-III at two time points (baseline and 48 months) were selected. Group-level volumetric analyses revealed that the volumetric reductions in the left striatum were associated with the decline in motor functioning. Then, we developed a patient-specific multivariate gray matter volumetric distance and demonstrated that it could significantly predict changes in motor symptom scores (P < 0.05). Further, we classified patients as relatively slower and faster progressors with 89% accuracy using a support vector machine classifier. Thus, we identified a promising structural MRI-based biomarker for predicting the rate of progression of motor symptoms and classifying patients based on motor symptom severity.

Inflammatory Blood Biomarkers Are Associated with Long-Term Clinical Disease Severity in Parkinson's Disease.	An altered immune response has been identified as a pathophysiological factor in Parkinson's disease (PD). We aimed to identify blood immunity-associated proteins that discriminate PD from controls and that are associated with long-term disease severity in PD patients. Immune response-derived proteins in blood plasma were measured using Proximity Extension Technology by OLINK in a cohort of PD patients (N = 66) and age-matched healthy controls (N = 52). In a selection of 30 PD patients, we evaluated changes in protein levels 7-10 years after the baseline and assessed correlations with motor and cognitive assessments. Data from the Parkinson's Disease Biomarkers Program (PDBP) cohort and the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) cohort were used for independent validation. PD patients showed an altered immune response compared to controls based on a panel of four proteins (IL-12B, OPG, CXCL11, and CSF-1). The expression levels of five inflammation-associated proteins (CCL23, CCL25, TNFRSF9, TGF-alpha, and VEGFA) increased over time in PD and were partially associated with more severe motor and cognitive symptoms at follow-up. Increased CCL23 levels were associated with cognitive decline and the	CCL23; Parkinson’s disease; TGF-alpha; TNFRSF9; blood biomarkers; disease severity; immune response

Predicting longitudinal brain atrophy in Parkinson's disease using a Susceptible-Infected-Removed agent-based model.	Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by accumulation of abnormal isoforms of alpha-synuclein. Alpha-synuclein is proposed to act as a prion in Parkinson's disease: In its misfolded pathologic state, it favors the misfolding of normal alpha-synuclein molecules, spreads trans-neuronally, and causes neuronal damage as it accumulates. This theory remains controversial. We have previously developed a Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) computational model that simulates the templating, propagation, and toxicity of alpha-synuclein molecules in the brain. In this study, we test this model with longitudinal MRI collected over 4 years from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (1,068 T1 MRI scans, 790 Parkinson's disease scans, and 278 matched control scans). We find that brain deformation progresses in subcortical and cortical regions. The SIR model recapitulates the spatiotemporal distribution of brain atrophy observed in Parkinson's disease. We show that connectome topology and geometry significantly contribute to model fit. We also show that the spatial expression of two genes implicated in alpha-synuclein synthesis and clearance,	Alpha-synuclein; Brain networks; MRI; Neurodegeneration

Parkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic and progressive neurological disease that mostly shakes and compromises the motor system of the human brain. Patients with PD can face resting tremors, loss of balance, bradykinesia, and rigidity problems. Complex patterns of PD, i.e., with relevance to other neurological diseases and minor changes in brain structure, make the diagnosis of this disease a challenge and cause inaccuracy of about 25% in the diagnostics. The research community utilizes different machine learning techniques for diagnosis using handcrafted features. This paper proposes a computer-aided diagnostic system using a convolutional neural network (CNN) to diagnose PD. CNN is one of the most suitable models to extract and learn the essential features of a problem. The dataset is obtained from Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI), which provides different datasets (benchmarks), such as T2-weighted MRI for PD and other healthy controls (HC). The mid slices are collected from each MRI. Further, these slices are registered for alignment. Since the PD can be found in substantia nigra (i.e., the midbrain), the midbrain region of the registered T2-weighted MRI slice is selected using the freehand region of interest technique with a 33 × 33 sized window. Several experiments have been carried out to ensure the validity of the CNN. The standard measures, such as accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve, are used to evaluate the proposed system. The evaluation results show that CNN provides better accuracy than machine learning techniques, such as naive Bayes, decision tree, support vector machine, and artificial neural network.

INTRODUCTION: The neuroanatomical structures implicated in olfactory and emotional processing overlap significantly. Our understanding of the relationship between hyposmia and apathy, common manifestations of early Parkinson's disease (PD), is inadequate. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed data on 40 patients with early de-novo idiopathic PD enrolled within 2 years of motor symptom onset in the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) study. To be included in the analysis, patients must have smell dysfunction but no apathy at the baseline visit and had completed a diffusion MRI (dMRI) at the baseline visit and at the 48-month follow-up visit. We used the FMRIB Software Library's diffusion tool kit to measure fractional anisotropy (FA) in six regions of interest on dMRI: bilateral anterior corona radiata, left cingulum, left superior corona radiata, genu and body of the corpus callosum. We compared the FA in each region from the dMRI done at the beginning of the study with the follow up studies at 4 years. RESULTS: We found a significant decrease of FA at the bilateral anterior corona radiata, and the genu and body of the corpus callosum comparing baseline scans with follow up images at 4-years after starting the study. CONCLUSION: Structural connectivity changes associated with apathy can be seen early in PD patients with smell dysfunction.	Apathy; Diffusion MRI; Network; Parkinson's disease; Smell dysfunction

Machine learning-based prediction of longitudinal cognitive decline in early Parkinson's disease using multimodal features.	Patients with Parkinson's Disease (PD) often suffer from cognitive decline. Accurate prediction of cognitive decline is essential for early treatment of at-risk patients. The aim of this study was to develop and evaluate a multimodal machine learning model for the prediction of continuous cognitive decline in patients with early PD. We included 213 PD patients from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) database. Machine learning was used to predict change in Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score using the difference between baseline and 4-years follow-up data as outcome. Input features were categorized into four sets: clinical test scores, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, brain volumes, and genetic variants. All combinations of input feature sets were added to a basic model, which consisted of demographics and baseline cognition. An iterative scheme using RReliefF-based feature ranking and support vector regression in combination with tenfold cross validation was used to determine the optimal number of predictive features and to evaluate model performance for each combination of input feature sets. Our best performing model consisted of a combination of the basic model, clinical test scores and CSF-based biomarkers. This model had 12 features, which included baseline cognition, CSF phosphorylated tau, CSF total tau, CSF amyloid-beta

Basal Forebrain Atrophy, Cortical Thinning, and Amyloid-β Status in Parkinson's disease-Related Cognitive Decline.	BACKGROUND: Degeneration of the cortically-projecting cholinergic basal forebrain (cBF) is a well-established pathologic correlate of cognitive decline in Parkinson's disease (PD). In Alzheimer's disease (AD) the effect of cBF degeneration on cognitive decline was found to be mediated by parallel atrophy of denervated cortical areas. OBJECTIVES: To examine whether the association between cBF degeneration and cognitive decline in PD is mediated by parallel atrophy of cortical areas and whether these associations depend on the presence of comorbid AD pathology. METHODS: We studied 162 de novo PD patients who underwent serial 3 T magnetic resonance imaging scanning (follow-up: 2.33 ± 1.46 years) within the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative. cBF volume and regional cortical thickness were automatically calculated using established procedures. Individual slopes of structural brain changes and cognitive decline were estimated using linear-mixed models. Associations between longitudinal cBF degeneration, regional cortical thinning, and cognitive decline were assessed using regression analyses and mediation effects were assessed using nonparametric bootstrap. Complementary analyses assessed the effect of amyloid-β biomarker positivity on these associations. RESULTS: After controlling for global brain atrophy, longitudinal cBF degeneration was highly correlated with faster cortical thinning (P CONCLUSIONS: cBF degeneration in PD is linked to parallel thinning of cortical target areas, which mediate the effect on cognitive decline. These associations are independent of amyloid-β status, indicating that they reflect proper features of PD pathophysiology. © 2023 The Authors.

Cerebrospinal fluid GFAP is a predictive biomarker for conversion to dementia and Alzheimer's disease-associated biomarkers alterations among de novo Parkinson's disease patients: a prospective cohort study.	BACKGROUND: Dementia is a prevalent non-motor manifestation among individuals with advanced Parkinson's disease (PD). Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) is an inflammatory marker derived from astrocytes. Research has demonstrated the potential of plasma GFAP to forecast the progression to dementia in PD patients with mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI). However, the predictive role of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) GFAP on future cognitive transformation and alterations in Alzheimer's disease (AD)-associated CSF biomarkers in newly diagnosed PD patients has not been investigated. METHODS: 210 de novo PD patients from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative were recruited. Cognitive progression in PD participants was evaluated using Cox regression. Cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between baseline CSF GFAP and cognitive function and AD-related CSF biomarkers were evaluated using multiple linear regression and generalized linear mixed model. RESULTS: At baseline, the mean age of PD participants was 60.85 ± 9.78 years, including 142 patients with normal cognition (PD-NC) and 68 PD-MCI patients. The average follow-up time was 6.42 ± 1.69 years. A positive correlation was observed between baseline CSF GFAP and age (β = 0.918, p < 0.001). There was no statistically significant difference in baseline CSF GFAP levels between PD-NC and PD-MCI groups. Higher baseline CSF GFAP predicted greater global cognitive decline over time in early PD patients (Montreal Cognitive Assessment, β = - 0.013, p = 0.014). Furthermore, Cox regression showed that high baseline CSF GFAP levels were associated with a high risk of developing dementia over an 8-year period in the PD-NC group (adjusted HR = 3.070, 95% CI 1.119-8.418, p = 0.029). In addition, the baseline CSF GFAP was positively correlated with the longitudinal changes of not only CSF α-synuclein (β = 0.313, p < 0.001), but also CSF biomarkers associated with AD, namely, amyloid-β 42 (β = 0.147, p = 0.034), total tau (β = 0.337, p < 0.001) and phosphorylated tau (β = 0.408, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: CSF GFAP may be a valuable prognostic tool that can predict the severity and progression of cognitive deterioration, accompanied with longitudinal changes in AD-associated pathological markers in early PD.

Nonlinear Weighting Ensemble Learning Model to Diagnose Parkinson's Disease Using Multimodal Data.	Parkinson's Disease (PD) is the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder among adults. Although its triggers are still not clear, they may be due to a combination of different types of biomarkers measured through medical imaging, metabolomics, proteomics or genetics, among others. In this context, we have proposed a Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) system that combines structural and functional imaging data from subjects in Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative dataset by means of an Ensemble Learning methodology trained to identify and penalize input sources with low classification rates and/ or high-variability. This proposal improves results published in recent years and provides an accurate solution not only from the point of view of image preprocessing (including a comparison between different intensity preservation techniques), but also in terms of dimensionality reduction methods (Isomap). In addition, we have also introduced a bagging classification schema for scenarios with unbalanced data. As shown by our results, the CAD proposal is able to detect PD with [Formula: see text] of balanced accuracy, and opens up the possibility of combining any number of input data sources relevant for PD.

Prognostic significance of peripheral neutrophils and lymphocytes in early untreated Parkinson's disease: an 8-year follow-up study.	BACKGROUND: To explore whether peripheral blood neutrophils and lymphocytes are associated with longitudinal motor and cognitive decline in patients with early Parkinson's disease (PD) and, to uncover the disease-specific mechanisms underlying these associations. METHODS: Data were obtained from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative cohort. We included 376 patients with recently diagnosed, drug-naïve PD and 178 matched healthy controls. The patients underwent annual assessments, including the Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) part 3 test to measure motor function and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) to measure cognitive function, for up to 8 years of follow-up. Dopamine transporter (DAT) imaging was performed at baseline and the 1-year, 2-year and 4-year follow-up visits. RESULTS: At baseline, patients with PD showed higher neutrophil and lower lymphocyte counts, resulting in a higher neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) than that in healthy controls. Higher neutrophil counts were associated with a greater increase in MDS-UPDRS part 3 scores in patients with PD (estimate: 0.25, 95% CI: 0.12 to 0.37, p<0.001). Correspondingly, higher neutrophil levels were related to a greater reduction in DAT activity in the caudate (estimate: -0.007, 95% CI: -0.014 to -0.001, p=0.046) and putamen (estimate: -0.0039, 95% CI: -0.0077 to -0.0002, p=0.042). However, there were no significant effects of lymphocyte count and NLR on changes in the MDS-UPDRS part 3 and MoCA scores and striatal DAT uptake over time. CONCLUSION: Among the blood biomarkers, only a higher neutrophil count was associated with faster motor progression along with accelerated nigrostriatal dopaminergic degeneration in patients with PD. The impact of neutrophils and lymphocytes on longitudinal cognitive changes remains unclear. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT01141023.	COGNITION; NEUROIMMUNOLOGY; PARKINSON'S DISEASE

BACKGROUND: Amyloid beta (Aβ), phosphorylated tau (p-tau), and total tau (t-tau) in cerebrospinal fluid are established biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease (AD). In other neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's disease (PD), these biomarkers have also been found to be altered, and the molecular mechanisms responsible for these alterations are still under investigation. Moreover, the interplay between these mechanisms and the diverse underlying disease states remains to be elucidated.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: It has been recently suggested that LRRK2 mutations are associated with a more benign clinical phenotype and a potentially more preserved cholinergic function in Parkinson's disease (PD). However, to our knowledge, no studies have tested whether the better clinical progression observed in LRRK2-PD patients is associated with more preserved volumes of a cholinergic brain area, the basal forebrain (BF). To address this hypothesis, here we compared BF volumes in LRRK2 carriers with and without PD with respect to idiopathic PD (iPD) patients and controls, and assessed whether they are associated with better clinical progression observed in LRRK2-PD compared to iPD. METHODS: Thirty-one symptomatic LRRK2-PD patients and 13 asymptomatic LRRK2 individuals were included from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative. In addition, 31 patients with iPD and 13 healthy controls matched to the previous groups were also included. BF volumes were automatically extracted from baseline T1-weighted MRI scans using a stereotactic atlas of cholinergic nuclei. These volumes were then compared between groups and their relationship with longitudinal cognitive changes was evaluated using linear mixed effects models. Mediation analyses assessed whether BF volumes mediated differences in cognitive trajectories between groups. RESULTS: LRRK2-PD patients showed significantly higher BF volumes compared to iPD (P = 0.019) as did asymptomatic LRRK2 subjects compared to controls (P = 0.008). There were no other significant differences in cortical regions or subcortical volumes between these groups. BF volumes predicted longitudinal decline in several cognitive functions in iPD patients but not in LRRK2-PD, who did not show cognitive changes over a 4-year follow-up period. BF volumes were a significant mediator of the different cognitive trajectories between iPD and LRRK2-PD patients (95% CI 0.056-2.955). DISCUSSION: Our findings suggest that mutations in LRRK2 are associated with increased BF volumes, potentially reflecting a compensatory hypercholinergic state that could prevent cognitive decline in LRRK2-PD patients.

Sex Differences in Brain Structure in de novo Parkinson's Disease: A Cross-Sectional and Longitudinal Neuroimaging Study.	BACKGROUND: Parkinson's disease (PD) varies in occurrence, presentation, and severity between males and females. However, the sex effects on the patterns of brain structure, cross-sectionally and longitudinally, are still unclear. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to compare sex differences in brain features cross-sectionally and longitudinally using grey matter volume (GMV) and cortical thickness in a large sample of newly diagnosed drug-naive PD patients. METHODS: Cognitive assessments and structural MR images of 262 PD patients (171 males) and 113 healthy controls (68 males) were selected from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative. Of these, 97 PD patients (66 males) completed 12- and 24-month follow-up examinations. After regressing out the expected effects of age and sex, brain maps of GMV and cortical thickness were compared using two-sample t tests cross-sectionally and were compared using repeated measurement analyses of variance longitudinally. RESULTS: At baseline, male PD patients exhibited a greater extent of brain atrophy and cortical thickness reduction than females, which mainly occurred in the cerebellum, frontal lobe, parietal lobe, and temporal lobe. At follow-up, female and male PD patients showed similar dynamics of disease progression, as both groups declined over time while the females maintained the advantage. The cortical thickness of the right precentral gyrus at baseline was negatively associated with the longitudinal changes of motor function in male PD patients. CONCLUSION: The current findings might demonstrate sex effect in neuroanatomy during the course of PD, provide new insights into the neurodegenerative process, and facilitate the development of more effective sex-specific therapeutic strategies.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by widespread molecular dysregulation, with the APOEe4 allele recognized as its strongest genetic risk factor. However, the mechanisms by which APOEe4 drives distinct molecular changes - whether by exacerbating pathology or triggering compensatory responses - remain incompletely understood. We generated and analyzed proteomic, epigenetic, and genetic data from post-mortem dorsolateral prefrontal cortex samples of a uniquely APOEe4-enriched subset of the Religious Orders Study and Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP). Specifically, we generated DIA LC-MS proteomic data (n = 302), analyzed previously generated DNA methylation profiles from our group (n = 310), and used published whole-genome sequencing data (n = 254) to compute polygenic risk scores (PRS). In this cohort, 69% (n = 214) were APOEe4 carriers, and 19.6% (n = 42) of them showed no pathological evidence of AD based on NIA-Reagan criteria, enabling identification of APOEe4-related risk and resilience mechanisms. In the absence of AD, APOEe4 carriers exhibited lower levels of 27 proteins, suggesting early synaptic (e.g., VAMP1, SYN3, CASKIN1) and metabolic (e.g., GLUD1, PI4KA) vulnerability. By contrast, APOEe4 carriers with AD displayed marked upregulation of inflammatory and proteostatic proteins (e.g., GNAO1, AHNAK, FGG, HEBP1, APEX1, RAB4A, SLC12A5, LRP1, BAG6) and hypermethylation of cg06329447 in ELAVL4. Network analyses highlighted convergent disruptions in synaptic transmission, metabolism, and proteostasis - key pathways altered in APOEe4-associated AD. Mediation analyses identified GRIPAP1 and GSTK1 as top protein mediators (accounting for ∼26-33% of APOEe4's effect), with VAMP1, CASKIN1, DPP3, SYN3, and FGG each contributing ∼9-15%. ELAVL4 hypermethylation also mediated ∼12% of the APOEe4 effect, linking epigenetic dysregulation to disease risk. To assess whether the identified proteins reflected broader genetic risk for AD or were specific to APOEe4, we calculated PRS both excluding and including the APOE genomic region. While the non-APOE PRS showed no association with identified molecular markers, the APOE-inclusive PRS was significantly associated with eight AD-related proteins in carriers, indicating they are not explained by polygenic risk outside of APOE. Finally, predictive modeling stratified by APOEe4 status revealed that in non-carriers, PRS most effectively classified AD (AUC = 0.73), whereas in carriers, proteomic and epigenetic markers outperformed PRS (AUC up to 0.74). Together, these findings demonstrate that APOEe4 confers AD risk through early synaptic and metabolic disruptions and later-stage inflammatory and epigenetic changes, laying the groundwork for genotype-tailored biomarker development and therapeutic strategies.

TAS2R38-Linked MGAM Expression in Alzheimer's Disease: A Novel Target for Precision Drug Repurposing.	OBJECTIVE: TAS2R38 is a taste receptor implicated in innate immunity. Identifying its genetic connection with Alzheimer's disease (AD) could aid in developing new drugs or repurposing existing ones for treatment. METHODS: We examined the relationship between TAS2R38 taster variants and AD risk using linear mixed-effects models, utilizing data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) (n = 2,342). We investigated molecular mechanisms of the association by identifying expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) using RNA-seq data from postmortem tissues from the Religious Orders Study/Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP) (n = 947). We evaluated whether FDA-approved drugs targeting the identified gene could reduce dementia risk using 1:1 propensity score-matched groups in the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC) study, comparing cognitive performance between drug-taking and non-taking patients with linear mixed-effects models (n = 76). RESULTS: TAS2R38 supertasters were linked to reduced AD risk with advancing age in various AD biomarkers (P < 0.001). eQTL analysis connected the nontaster allele to increased expression of the gene MGAM in AD-affected brain regions (P < 0.001). Elevated MGAM expression was also associated with more severe Tau burdens (P < 0.05). A significant group difference was observed in clinical dementia rating (CDR) progression (P < 0.001) in various domains for individuals taking MGAM-inhibiting diabetes drugs (Acarbose and Miglitol) compared to the non-taking group. INTERPRETATION: The genetic association between TAS2R38 and AD biomarkers implicates MGAM as a novel drug target with existing FDA-approved inhibitors. This supports the potential of TAS2R38 haplotypes in guiding precision drug repurposing strategies for AD, warranting clinical trials.

Mitochondrial complex III-derived ROS amplify immunometabolic changes in astrocytes and promote dementia pathology.	Neurodegenerative disorders alter mitochondrial functions, including the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Mitochondrial complex III (CIII) generates ROS implicated in redox signalling, but its triggers, temporal dynamics, targets and disease relevance are not clear. Here, using site-selective suppressors and genetic manipulations together with live mitochondrial ROS imaging and multiomic profiling, we show that CIII is a dominant source of ROS production in astrocytes exposed to neuropathology-related stimuli. Astrocytic CIII ROS production is dependent on nuclear factor-κB and the mitochondrial sodium-calcium exchanger (NCLX) and causes oxidation of select cysteines within immune- and metabolism-associated proteins linked to neurological disease. CIII ROS amplify metabolomic and pathology-associated transcriptional changes in astrocytes, with STAT3 activity as a major mediator, and facilitate neuronal toxicity. Therapeutic suppression of CIII ROS in mice decreases dementia-linked tauopathy and neuroimmune cascades and extends lifespan. Our findings establish CIII ROS as an important immunometabolic signal transducer and tractable therapeutic target in neurodegenerative disease.

Integrative brain omics approach highlights sn-1 lysophosphatidylethanolamine in Alzheimer's dementia.	The biology of individual lipid species and their relevance in Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains incompletely understood. To explore the lipidomic biomarkers associated with cognition function and neuropathological changes in AD, we utilize non-targeted mass spectrometry on 316 post-mortem brains from participants in the Religious Orders Study (ROS) or Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP) cohorts classified as control, asymptomatic AD (AAD), or symptomatic AD (SAD), and integrate the lipidomics data with untargeted proteomics from the same individuals. We find that lysophosphatidylethanolamine (LPE) and lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) species are significantly lower in SAD than controls or AAD. Lipid-protein network analyses reveal that LPE/LPC modules are significantly associated with protein modules involved in MAPK/metabolism, post-synaptic density, and cell-ECM interaction pathways, and correlate with better antemortem cognition and reduced AD neuropathology. Particularly, LPE 22:6 [sn-1] is significantly decreased SAD and exerts a pronounced influence on protein changes relevant to neurotransmitter-driven post synaptic changes and plasticity compared to other lysophospholipids species. These findings suggest LPE 22:6 as a potential lipid signature and therapeutic target for AD.

Intranasal delivery of DPSC-derived small extracellular vesicles-encased phloroglucinol attenuates non-motor and motor deficits and promotes neurogenesis in an in vivo rat model of Parkinson's disease.	BACKGROUND: Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by dopaminergic (DA) neuron degeneration in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) driven by oxidative stress, inflammation, and impaired neurogenesis. Phloroglucinol, a polyphenolic antioxidant, has demonstrated neuroprotective effects in PD models but suffers from limited clinical applicability due to poor blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability. Small extracellular vesicles (sEV) derived from dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs) exhibit neuroprotective and immunomodulatory properties and serve as promising vehicles for targeted drug delivery across the BBB. This study aimed to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of intranasally administered sEV-encased phloroglucinol (sEV-Phl) in a chronic MPTP rat model of PD. METHODS: DPSC-derived sEV were isolated via density gradient ultracentrifugation and characterized using Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), Dynamic-Light-Scattering (DLS), and CD marker expression. Phloroglucinol was encased in sEV (sEV-Phl) using sonication. Antioxidant properties were tested in vitro using an H RESULTS: sEV displayed high purity and homogeneity. sEV-Phl significantly reduced oxidative stress both in vitro and in vivo, as indicated by decreased ROS and lipid peroxidation levels. sEV-Phl treated MPTP rats demonstrated marked improvement in motor and non-motor behaviours compared to MPTP rats. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed increased TH-positive neurons and enhanced neurogenesis in the SNpc of sEV-Phl-treated animals. Biodistribution studies confirmed efficient midbrain targeting of sEV, which were localized to dopaminergic-neurons, astrocytes and microglia. sEV-Phl also significantly reduced TNF-α expression, indicating decreased neuroinflammation. CONCLUSION: This study provides the first instance of using DPSC-derived sEV as a delivery vehicle for phloroglucinol in a PD model. sEV-Phl demonstrated significant neuroprotective-effects, enhanced DA-neuron survival and neurogenesis, and reduced neuroinflammation. Intranasal delivery of sEV-Phl represents a promising non-invasive therapeutic strategy for PD, offering a dual benefit of antioxidative and neurogenic support.

Predicting severity of cerebral amyloid angiopathy neuropathology: A modeling approach using NACC and ROSMAP data.	INTRODUCTION: Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is associated with an increased risk of amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA) in patients with Alzheimer's disease using anti-amyloid beta (Aβ) monoclonal antibody drugs. Here, we developed a tool, CAA risk score (CAARS) to predict the severity of CAA neuropathology. METHODS: The National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC) data were used to develop the CAARS, which was then externally validated using the Religious Orders Study and Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP) data. RESULTS: The CAARS-4 model achieved a mean area under the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC-ROC) of 0.71 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.69-0.72) and a Harrell's generalized C-index of 0.69 (95% CI: 0.68-0.71) in the NACC cohort validation. It outperformed the baseline models, and the promising performance was validated on ROSMAP participants, demonstrating the robustness and generalizability of the model. DISCUSSION: CAARS has the potential to predict CAA severity; however, its clinical utility should be evaluated in follow-up studies. HIGHLIGHTS: Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) severity can only be confirmed postmortem. CAA is associated with an elevated risk of amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA). The CAA risk score (CAARS) can stratify CAA risks in living patients. Hypertension and apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 are risk factors for CAA. The CAARS has the potential to predict risk of ARIA.

This study investigates the cytokine gene expression profile in cortical tissue samples from elderly individuals with and without AD to identify potential biomarkers and enhance our understanding of disease pathogenesis. Utilizing high-depth RNA sequencing data, we identified a set of cytokines whose expression significantly associated with different aspects of the AD phenotype, including measures of neurofibrillary tangles, amyloid-β deposition, and a person-specific rate of cognitive decline. Single-nucleus transcriptomics data facilitated the identification of specific cell types, such as microglia and astrocytes, that significantly contribute to the inflammatory response in AD. Additionally, we observed a correlation between the expression of certain cytokines and genetic risk for the disease. Our findings indicate that cytokine-mediated neuroinflammation may play an important role in neurodegeneration and that modulating the immune response may offer a promising strategy for developing new therapies.

Genetic and pathway complexity in Alzheimer's disease: Insights from multi-omic data about the immune response and mitochondrial function.	Despite recent developments, the genetics and biology of Alzheimer's disease remain insufficiently characterized. As an important first step toward developing effective treatment strategies to slow or prevent Alzheimer's disease onset, the identification of relevant genetic markers is crucial. In the present study, we analyzed transcriptomic and multi-omic datasets across multiple cohorts (the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, Religious Orders Study and Rush Memory and Aging Project, Mount Sinai Brain Bank, and Mayo Clinic Alzheimer's Disease Genetics Studies) using gene set enrichment analysis, machine learning algorithms, and polygenic risk scoring to identify gene sets relevant to Alzheimer's disease risk and pathological features. For prioritized gene sets, we performed epigenome-wide association studies to assess DNA methylation patterns, and used multi-omic mediation analysis to characterize the causal gene regulatory networks. Overall, we identified several key gene sets relevant to Alzheimer's disease pathology-particularly, those related to immune system function and mitochondrial dysfunction. Upregulated pathways, including neutrophil degranulation and tumor necrosis factor-α signaling pathways, correlated strongly with aspects of neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's disease. By contrast, downregulated oxidative phosphorylation pathways further suggested mitochondrial dysfunction. Gene sets that contained mitochondrially located genes (e.g., SGK1 and LRRK1) were identified as significantly contributing to neurodegeneration. Moreover, genes such as CXCL1, TGFB2, and DUSP1 were consistently implicated in all datasets, thus emphasizing their involvement in immune modulation and mitochondrial function. The multimodal investigation outlined in the current study represents useful steps toward comprehending the genetic architecture of Alzheimer's disease, including an expanded understanding of the spatial interactions of genes associated with disease susceptibility. Mitochondrial dysfunction and immune modulation were pathological pathways that converged on Alzheimer's disease and future treatment novel options. Using the frameworks provided in the current comprehensive study, we present opportunities to explore targeted treatment strategies that may alter immune systems and mitochondrial function to optimize treatment outcomes for individuals at increased risk of or living with Alzheimer's disease.

Lobetyolin, an anti-AD factor from the diet campanulaceae source, metabolism regulation and target exploration.	Bioactive compounds from food-compatible medicinal herbs have shown promise as preventive agents against age-related neurodegenerative conditions, particularly Alzheimer's disease (AD). The present work aimed to find Lobetyolin as a new suppressor of Aβ aggregation and its interventions on abnormal metabolism in AD. Aβ-expressing Caenorhabditis elegans (strain CL4176) and wild-type worms were employed to evaluate paralysis onset, lifespan, cerebral Aβ deposition, and intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) after Lobetyolin administration. Untargeted ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC-HRMS) metabolomics coupled with RNA-seq transcriptomics was carried out to profile systemic metabolic and gene-expression changes. Differential metabolites and transcripts were subjected to Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), Gene Ontology (GO), and pathway-impact analyses; hub targets were prioritized by integrating enrichment scores with in-silico docking. Lobetyolin (12.5-50 µM) markedly protected C. elegans from Aβ-driven toxicity and oxidative stress. In CL2006 worms, β-amyloid deposits fell by 54.8 ± 9.4%, while paralysis in CL4176 was delayed by 20.9 ± 4.5%. Lifespan increased by up to 18.2% in CL4176 and 25.0% in wild-type N2 worms. Concomitantly, intracellular ROS declined maximally by 28.1 ± 8.9% (N2) and 22.4 ± 3.8% (CL4176). Integrative metabolomic-transcriptomic analyses, validated by RT-qPCR, revealed selective remodeling of glutathione metabolism: gst-38 expression was suppressed, whereas gst-1 was elevated. Lobetyolin confers neuroprotective and geroprotective benefits in vivo, primarily through reprogramming glutathione-centered redox metabolism and selectively modulating glutathione-S-transferases (GST) isoforms. These findings position Lobetyolin as a promising dietary lead compound for AD prevention and healthy aging interventions.

The role of redox-active iron, copper, manganese, and redox-inactive zinc in toxicity, oxidative stress, and human diseases.	Given the key importance played by the redox-active metals iron (Fe), copper (Cu), and manganese (Mn) in vital cellular processes, such as DNA synthesis, oxidative phosphorylation, the detoxification of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and angiogenesis, it is not surprising that their dysregulation plays a causative role in many human diseases. The same applies to redox-inactive zinc (Zn), which is involved in numerous biological functions, and serves as a structural element, a catalyst, and a participant in both intracellular and intercellular signaling and in maintaining immune system function. An imbalance in redox active (Fe, Cu, Mn) or redox inactive (Zn) metal ions, whether in excess or deficiency, is harmful and may disrupt the structural, regulatory, and catalytic roles of various antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutases (SODs), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidases (GPxs)), proteins, receptors, transporters, alter sulfhydryl homeostasis, generate high levels of ROS (e.g., hydroxyl radicals by the Fenton reaction), initiate lipid peroxidation, cause DNA damage, and lead to cell death via mechanisms such as ferroptosis, cuproptosis, cellular senescence, or inflammation. Maintaining redox homeostasis is essential for regulating numerous cellular signaling pathways. Redox-sensitive signaling pathways, such as the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MAPK), and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) pathways, form an intricate network that governs cellular responses to redox metal-induced oxidative stress and inflammation. The Nrf2 pathway is primarily responsible for mediating antioxidant defenses, whereas the NF-κB and MAPK pathways play roles in proinflammatory and stress-related responses. Dysregulation of redox-active Fe, Cu, Mn, and redox-inactive Zn can alter epigenetic regulatory mechanisms such as DNA methylation, histone modification, and non-coding RNA expression. The dyshomeostasis of metal ions is closely related to the pathogenesis of lung, renal, and gastrointestinal diseases, neurodegenerative disorders (Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disease), psychiatric conditions (schizophrenia), and various cancers. This review summarizes recent findings on the role of iron, copper, manganese, and zinc in maintaining physiological functions, redox homeostasis, and human diseases.

Programmed cell death signatures-driven microglial transformation in Alzheimer's disease: single-cell transcriptomics and functional validation.	BACKGROUND: This study aims to develop and validate a programmed cell death signature (PCDS) for predicting and classifying Alzheimer's disease (AD) using an integrated machine learning framework. We further explore the role of S100A4 in AD pathogenesis, particularly in microglia. METHODS: A total of one single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and four bulk RNA-seq datasets from multiple GEO datasets were analyzed. Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) was utilized to identify PCD-related genes. An integrated machine learning framework, combining 12 algorithms was used to construct a PCDS model. The performance of PCDS was validated using multiple independent cohorts. RESULTS: ScRNA-seq analysis revealed higher PCD levels in microglia from AD patients. Seventy-seven PCD-related genes were identified, with 70 genes used to construct the PCDS model. The optimal model, combining Stepglm and Random Forest, achieved an average AUC of 0.832 across five cohorts. High PCDS correlated with upregulated pathways related to inflammation and immune response, while low PCDS associated with protective pathways. CONCLUSION: This study developed a robust PCDS model for AD prediction and identified S100A4 as a potential therapeutic target. The findings highlight the importance of PCD pathways in AD pathogenesis and provide new insights for early diagnosis and intervention.

Uncovering plaque-glia niches in human Alzheimer's disease brains using spatial transcriptomics.	BACKGROUND: Amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques and their associated glial responses are hallmark features of Alzheimer's disease (AD), yet their interactions within the human brain remain poorly defined. METHODS: We applied spatial transcriptomics (ST) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) to 78 postmortem brain sections from 21 individuals in the Religious Orders Study and Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP). We paired ST with histological data and stratified spots into major categories of plaque-glia niches based on Aβ, GFAP, and IBA1 intensity. Leveraging published ROSMAP single-nucleus RNA-seq data, we examined differences in gene expression, cellular composition, and intercellular communication across these niches. Neuronal and glial changes were validated by IHC and quantitative analyses. We further characterized glial responses using gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) with known mouse glial signatures and human AD-associated microglial states. Finally, we used iPSC-derived multicellular cultures and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to identify cell types that, upon short-term Aβ exposure, recapitulate the glial responses observed in the human spatial data. RESULTS: Low-Aβ regions, enriched for diffuse plaques, exhibited transcriptomic profiles consistent with greater neuronal loss than high-Aβ regions. High-glia regions showed increased expression of inflammatory and neurodegenerative pathways. Spatial glial responses aligned with established gene modules, including plaque-induced genes (PIGs), oligodendrocyte (OLIG) responses, disease-associated microglia (DAM), disease-associated astrocytes (DAA), and human AD-associated microglial states, indicating that diverse glial phenotypes emerge around plaques and shape the local immune environment. IHC confirmed elevated neuronal apoptosis near low-Aβ plaques and greater CD68 abundance and synaptic loss near glia-high plaques. In vitro, iPSC-derived microglia-but not astrocytes-exposed to Aβ displayed transcriptomic changes that closely mirrored the glial states identified in our ST dataset. CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides a comprehensive spatial transcriptomic dataset from human AD brain tissue and bridges spatial gene expression with traditional neuropathology. By integrating ST, snRNA-seq, and human multicellular models, we map cellular states and molecular events within plaque-glia niches. This work offers a spatially resolved framework for dissecting plaque-glia interactions and reveals new insights into the cellular and molecular heterogeneity underlying neurodegenerative pathology.

Preclinical evidence and potential mechanisms of tanshinone ⅡA on cognitive function in animal models of Alzheimer's disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis.	BACKGROUND: Tanshinone ⅡA (Tan ⅡA) is a monomer extracted from OBJECTIVE: This systematic review and meta-analysis (SR/MA) aimed to evaluate the overall effects of Tan ⅡA on cognitive function in AD animal models and to summarize the mechanisms. METHODS: Seven databases (PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Chinese Biological Medical Disc, Chongqing VIP, and Wanfang databases) and grey literature were retrieved. Risk of bias was evaluated following the Systematic Review Center for Laboratory Animal Experiments. The mean difference (MD) or standard mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to evaluate the effect of Tan ⅡA on cognitive function, neuropathology, neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, apoptosis, and neural/synaptic plasticity, with RESULTS: Nineteen studies involving 581 AD animals were identified. The included studies showed satisfactory reporting quality but had certain risks of bias in methodology. Tan ⅡA ameliorated cognitive deficits, evidenced by reducing escape latency (MD = -17.94 s; 95% CI: -22.92 to -12.96) and increasing time spent in the target quadrant (MD = 10.69 s; 95% CI: 7.32-14.07). It attenuated neuropathological damage by reducing amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques in thioflavine S staining (SMD = -3.46; 95% CI: -5.65 to -1.26) and increasing neuronal density in Nissl staining (SMD = 2.82; 95% CI: 2.11-3.52) and NeuN staining (SMD = 2.89; 95% CI: 1.71-4.08). Tan ⅡA also demonstrated anti-inflammatory effects through downregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines [tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), and interleukin-6 (IL-6)] and antioxidant stress properties by increasing superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) levels while reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels. Additionally, it exhibited antiapoptotic effects by increasing the B-cell lymphoma-2/Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bcl-2/Bax) ratio and decreasing Caspase-3 expression. Moreover, treatment improved neuronal/synaptic plasticity by upregulating postsynaptic density-95 (PSD-95) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels. CONCLUSION: Tan ⅡA could improve cognitive function and neuropathology through multiple mechanisms. This suggests that Tan IIA may serve as a viable candidate for the development of therapeutic strategies for AD.

The utilization of artificial intelligence in studying the dysregulation of gene expression in Alzheimer's disease (AD) affected brain tissues remains underexplored, particularly in delineating common and specific transcriptomic signatures across different brain regions implicated in AD-related cellular and molecular processes, which could help illuminate novel disease biology for biomarker and target discovery. Herein we developed a deep learning framework, which consisted of multi-layer perceptron (MLP) models to classify neuropathologically confirmed AD versus controls, using bulk tissue RNA-seq data from the RNAseq Harmonization Study of the Accelerating Medicines Project for Alzheimer's Disease (AMP-AD) consortium. The models were trained based on data from three distinct brain regions, including dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), and head of the caudate nucleus (HCN), obtained from the Religious Orders Study/Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP). Subsequently, we inferred a disease progression trajectory for each brain region by applying unsupervised dimensionality transformation to the distribution of the subjects' expression profiles. To interpret the MLP models, we employed an interpretable method for deep neural network models, obtaining SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values and identified the most significantly AD-implicated genes for gene co-expression network analysis. Our models demonstrated robust performance in classification and prediction across two other external datasets from the Mayo RNA-seq (MAYO) cohort and the Mount Sinai Brain Bank (MSBB) cohort of AMP-AD. By interpreting the models both mechanistically and biologically, our study elucidated subtle molecular alterations in various brain regions, uncovering shared transcriptomic signatures activated in microglia and sex-specific modules in neurons relevant to AD. Notably, we identified, for the first time, a sex-linked transcription factor pair (ZFX/ZFY) associated with more pronounced neuronal loss in AD females, shedding light on a novel mechanism for sex dimorphism in AD. This study lays the groundwork for leveraging artificial intelligence methodologies to investigate AD at the molecular level, which is not readily achievable from conventional analysis approaches such as differential gene expression (DGE) analysis. The transcription factor implicated in sex difference also underpins a new molecular mechanistic basis of women's greater neurodegeneration in AD warranting further study.

Sex Differences in Associations of Lewy Body Disease with Alzheimer's Disease and Cognitive Decline.	OBJECTIVE: To investigate how sex and age at menopause influence the interplay between Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Lewy body disease (LBD) neuropathologies, and their associations with cognitive decline. METHODS: We analyzed data from: (1) three Rush Alzheimer's Disease Center cohorts (i.e., the Religious Orders Study, Rush Memory and Aging Project, and Minority Aging Research Study), and (2) the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center Neuropathology Data Set. Neuropathological evaluation assessed LBD (neocortical/limbic-type vs none) and AD, including neuritic plaques (β-amyloid plaques surrounded by dystrophic neurites) and neurofibrillary tangles. In each dataset, we tested interactive associations between LBD and sex on neuritic plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and cognitive decline. Additionally, in the Rush dataset, we tested whether age at spontaneous menopause modified the associations of LBD with neuritic plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and cognitive decline in women. RESULTS: In the Rush dataset, we included 1,277 women and 579 men. In the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center dataset, we included 3,283 women and 3,563 men. Across both datasets, men were more likely to have LBD, whereas women showed greater neuritic plaque and neurofibrillary tangle burdens. Sex modified the associations of LBD with neurofibrillary tangles (but not neuritic plaques), whereby LBD was more strongly associated with greater neurofibrillary tangle burden in women than men. Men showed faster LBD-related cognitive decline, whereas women showed faster neurofibrillary tangle-related decline, after adjusting for copathologies (neuritic plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and LBD, as appropriate). In women, earlier age at menopause exacerbated the associations of LBD with neurofibrillary tangle burden and episodic memory decline. INTERPRETATION: Sex may influence AD and LBD neuropathologies, highlighting the need for precision approaches to dementia prevention and intervention. ANN NEUROL 2025;98:1014-1026.

Aging is the strongest risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD), yet the molecular mechanisms linking aging to AD remain poorly understood. DNA methylation (DNAm) is an epigenetic modification that plays a critical role in gene regulation and has been implicated in both aging and AD. In this study, we performed a meta-analysis of DNAm profiles in the prefrontal cortex using two large, independent postmortem brain cohorts, the Religious Orders Study and Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP) and Brains for Dementia Research (BDR), to identify DNAm differences associated with aging in late life. We identified 3,264 CpGs significantly associated with aging, the majority of which were hypermethylated and enriched in promoter regions and CpG islands. These aging-associated DNAm changes were significantly overrepresented in genes involved in immune regulation and metabolic pathways. When compared with AD-associated DNAm changes, we found a significant overlap, with nearly all CpGs and differentially methylated regions (DMRs) that were associated with both aging and AD Braak stage displaying concordant directionality. This supports the hypothesis that aging and AD are interconnected at the molecular level. Further integrative analyses indicated that a number of these DNAm variants may have functional relevance in AD. By integrating blood DNAm data, we identified multiple CpGs that showed significant brain-to-blood correlations and were involved in both aging and AD pathogenesis. Co-localization analyses with genome-wide association study (GWAS) data revealed shared genetic regulation of DNAm and dementia at several AD risk loci. Out-of-sample validation using the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset demonstrated that, among 334 CpGs showing concordant DNAm changes in aging and AD, baseline DNAm levels at cg10752406 in the	Aging; Alzheimer’s disease; DNA methylation; biomarkers; epigenetics

An orally administered quinolinium molecule mitigates neuropathology of Alzheimer's disease through modulation of mitochondrial dysfunction and neuroinflammation.	Development of therapeutic options for Alzheimer's disease (AD) faces severe challenges. Only a few new anti-amyloid drugs based on monoclonal antibodies have been approved in recent years. Although the diversity of etiology and complexity of pathology make AD difficult to cure, these offer various molecular targets amenable for pharmaceutical interventions and disease modulation. In this study, we report an orally bioavailable quinolinium small molecule inhibitor, 88, to modulate neuropathologic changes in triple transgenic AD (3 × Tg-AD) mice. We have shown that 88 exhibited decent cerebral exposure, as compared with the forerunner quaternary isoquinolinium compound, 9Q, that we previously developed. In vivo studies revealed that 88 significantly mitigated cognitive deficits in 3 × Tg AD mice and decreased the amyloid burden as well as tau tangles in the hippocampus. Our data indicated that 88 treatments ameliorated the neuroinflammation via inhibiting glial activation and reducing cytokines IL-1β and IL-6. In vitro studies showed that 88 stabilized mitochondria membrane potential (MMP), decreased ROS generation, recovered respiratory function and ATP production in β-amyloid (Aβ)-induced PC12 cell model, suggesting mitigation of mitochondrial dysfunction. Such restored mitochondrial activity reduced the release of cytochrome c, which helped to prevent neuronal apoptosis both in vitro and in vivo. Our findings suggested that 88 could be useful in modulating AD, while the restoration of mitochondria functions and amelioration of neuroinflammation could be promising avenues for disease modulation.

Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are environmental pollutants that are hazardous to human health; can be produced by a variety of pathways; and are widely present in the environment, including air, soil, and water. When PAHs enter the human body, they accelerate cellular senescence and cellular ageing by promoting cell cycle arrest, inducing the excessive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and DNA methylation and mitochondrial dysfunction, thereby increasing the likelihood of disease, including reproductive disorders, Alzheimer's disease and cardiovascular diseases. Therefore, studying and combatting diseases caused by PAH exposure is critical. In this work, we elaborate on the mechanism of PAH toxicity and the diseases caused by PAHs from the perspective of the cellular senescence induced by PAHs, their central component benzo(a)pyrene, and their derivatives, with the aim of elucidating the molecular mechanisms of human diseases induced by PAHs through cellular senescence to provide theoretical support for the development of targeted preventive strategies and the maintenance of public health.

Brain Multi-Omic Subtypes of Neuroticism reveal molecular signatures linked to Alzheimer's Disease.	IMPORTANCE: Molecular mechanisms linking neuroticism with Alzheimer's disease traits are unknown. OBJECTIVE: To identify molecular subtypes of neuroticism and examine their association with ADRD traits. DESIGN: Three ongoing cohort studies were used; Religious Orders Study (ROS), Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP) and Minority Aging Research Study (MARS), that began enrollment in 1994, 1997, and 2004, respectively. SETTING: Older priests, nuns, and brothers from across the U.S. (ROS), older adults (MAP) and older African-American adults (MARS) from across the greater Chicago metropolitan area. PARTICIPANTS: 1,028 decedents with multi-omic data from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), the anterior cingulate cortex (AC), and the posterior cingulate gyrus (PCG). EXPOSURES: Eight layers of omics (DNA methylation and histone acetylation from DLPFC; RNA seq from AC, DLPFC, and PCG, single-nucleus RNA, TMT proteomics and metabolomics from DLPFC) and Neuroticism using the 12-item version from the NEO Five-Factor Inventory. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Person-specific multi-omic molecular pseudotime representing molecular progression from low to high phenotypic expression of neuroticism, and three multi-omic brain molecular subtypes of neuroticism which represent distinct omic pathways from no/low neuroticism to high neuroticism that differ by their omic constituents. Participants are exclusively assigned to the subtype which aligns mostly with their multi-omic profile. RESULTS: The top drivers of subtype differentiation were transcriptomic alterations across three brain regions (DLPFC, AC, PCG) which extensively and differentially characterized the subtypes. The subtypes were also differentially associated with AD pathology, temporal lobe atrophy, and AD dementia, with subtype N CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Neuroticism may be driven by three distinct molecular subtypes, with subtype N	ADRD; brain multi-omics; molecular pseudotime; molecular subtypes; neuroticism

Linking DNA methylation in brain regions to Alzheimer's disease risk: a Mendelian randomization study.	AIM: DNA methylation in brain regions represents a potential mechanism linking genetic variation to Alzheimer's disease (ad) risk, yet most studies have focused on blood-derived methylation markers. In this study, we conducted a systematic Mendelian randomization (MR) study to evaluate associations between predicted brain region-specific DNA methylation levels and ad risk, using methylation quantitative trait loci (mQTL) as genetic instruments. METHODS: We analyzed mQTLs from five human brain regions: cerebellum (CRBLM), frontal cortex (FCTX), causal pons (PONS), and temporal cortex (TCTX) from 600 individuals in Gibbs et al's study, as well as mQTLs from dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) of 543 participants in the Religious Orders Study and the Rush Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP). In our MR analyses, we integrated these mQTLs with single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP)-ad risk summary statistics derived from 85 934 ad-related cases and 401 577 normal controls. RESULTS: Among 62 554 cytosine-guanine dinucleotide (CpG) sites, we identified 597 CpG sites (CpGs) significantly associated with ad risk (false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05). Of these, 289 were confirmed through colocalization and summary-based MR (SMR) analyses, including one CpG site in CRBLM, 285 in DLPFC, one in FCTX, two in PONS, and one in TCTX. By integrating gene expression data, we identified 19 CpG sites with consistent associations across methylation levels, expression of eight target genes, and ad risk, including novel regulatory mechanisms involving RITA1's modulation of cg11558705 and PCGF3's regulation of cg10009224. CONCLUSION: Our findings highlight brain region-specific DNA methylation as a mediator of genetic risk for ad, offering insights into ad pathogenesis and identifying potential therapeutic targets.

Cardiovascular-Derived Circulating Cell-Free DNA Fragments Are Associated With Frailty and Increased Cardiovascular Events in Older Adults.	Increased cellular damage in aging tissues releases circulating cell-free genomic DNA (ccf-gDNA) into the bloodstream, and these fragments are associated with a higher risk of frailty and dementia. We hypothesized that identifying the tissue of origin for ccf-gDNA using methylation signatures can distinguish subgroups of participants with distinct clinical outcomes, biological aging rates, and energy use. Serum ccf-gDNA from 181 participants in the Religious Orders Study or Rush Memory and Aging Project (ROS-MAP) was assessed for DNA methylation at one timepoint using the Illumina MethylationEPIC array. Clinical outcomes 6 years after ccf-gDNA measurement were determined for the following: frailty, cognitive test scores, and cardiovascular disease. Hierarchical clustering identified major clusters based on the predominance of ccf-gDNA source: cardiovascular, erythrocyte progenitor, and immune cell. Participants with cardiovascular-enriched ccf-gDNA (CV ccf-gDNA) had higher rates of myocardial infarction (39%) at the last study visit compared to other subgroups (Immune ccf-gDNA: 21%; Erythrocyte ccf-gDNA: 23%), and similar findings were observed for congestive heart disease and stroke. There were no significant associations between cognitive test scores and ccf-gDNA subgroups. Individuals with CV ccf-gDNA demonstrated 3.1 times higher odds of being frail compared to the other groups and showed increased epigenetic age acceleration for the fragments compared to the other subgroups, indicating that this group was enriched with ccf-gDNA originating from older cells. The CV ccf-gDNA subgroup exhibited dysregulation of glycine and serine metabolism and pathways integral to cardiovascular health, endothelial function, and inflammation. We demonstrate that ccf-gDNA methylation patterns can detect high-turnover tissues and identify older adults at higher risk of frailty and cardiovascular disease.

Loss of the APP regulator RHBDL4 preserves memory in an Alzheimer's disease mouse model.	Characteristic cerebral pathological changes of Alzheimer's disease (AD) such as glucose hypometabolism or the accumulation of cleavage products of the amyloid precursor protein (APP), known as Aβ peptides, lead to sustained endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and neurodegeneration. To preserve ER homeostasis, cells activate their unfolded protein response (UPR). The rhomboid-like-protease 4 (RHBDL4) is an enzyme that participates in the UPR by targeting proteins for proteasomal degradation. We demonstrated previously that RHBDL4 cleaves APP in HEK293T cells, leading to decreased total APP and Aβ. More recently, we showed that RHBDL4 processes APP in mouse primary mixed cortical cultures as well. Here, we aim to examine the physiological relevance of RHBDL4 in the brain. We first found that brain samples from AD patients and an AD mouse model (APPtg) showed increased RHBDL4 mRNA and protein expression. To determine the effects of RHBDL4's absence on APP physiology in vivo, we crossed APPtg mice to a RHBDL4 knockout (R4

This review aims to summarize the recent advancements in the pathophysiological mechanisms of pyroptosis, mediated by NLRP3 inflammasome, in advancing PD and the anti-pyroptotic agents that target NLRP3 inflammatory pathways and miRNA. PD pathophysiology is primarily linked to the aggregation of α-synuclein, the overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and the development of neuroinflammation due to microglial activation. Prior research indicated that a significant quantity of microglia is activated in both PD patients and 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) mouse models, triggering neuroinflammation and resulting in a cascade of cellular death. Microglia possess an inflammatory complex pathway termed the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-, leucine-rich repeat, and pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome. Activation of the NLRP-3 inflammasome results in innate cytokines maturation, including IL-18 and IL-1β, which initiates the neuroinflammatory signal and induces a type of inflammatory cell death known as pyroptosis. Upon neuronal damage, intracellular levels of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), including reactive oxygen species (ROS), would build. DAMPs induce unregulated cell death and subsequent release of oxidative intermediates and pro-inflammatory cytokines, leading to the progression of PD. Thus, targeting of neuroinflammation using antipyroptotic medications can be efficiently achieved by blocking NLRP3 and obstructing IL-1β signaling and release. Furthermore, many research studies showed that miRNAs have been identified as regulators of the NLRP3 inflammasome and Nrf2 signal, which subsequently modulate the NLRP3-Nrf2 axis in PD. Nanotechnology promises potential for the advancement of miRNA-based therapies. Nanoparticles that ensure miRNA stability, traverse the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and distribute miRNA targeting regions needed to be created. In conclusion, targeting the pyroptosis pathway via NLRP3 or miRNA may serve as a prospective therapeutic strategy for PD in the future.	ASC; Inflammasome; Parkinson’s disorder; Pyroptosis

Structural variants linked to Alzheimer's disease and other common age-related clinical and neuropathologic traits.	BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder with substantial genetic influence. While genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified numerous risk loci for late-onset AD (LOAD), the functional mechanisms underlying most of these associations remain unresolved. Large genomic rearrangements, known as structural variants (SVs), represent a promising avenue for elucidating such mechanisms within some of these loci. METHODS: By leveraging data from two ongoing cohort studies of aging and dementia, the Religious Orders Study and Rush Memory and Aging Project (ROS/MAP), we performed genome-wide association analysis testing 20,205 common SVs from 1088 participants with whole genome sequencing (WGS) data. A range of Alzheimer's disease and other common age-related clinical and neuropathologic traits were examined. RESULTS: First, we mapped SVs across 81 AD risk loci and discovered 22 SVs in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with GWAS lead variants and directly associated with the phenotypes tested. The strongest association was a deletion of an Alu element in the 3'UTR of the TMEM106B gene, in high LD with the respective AD GWAS locus and associated with multiple AD and AD-related disorders (ADRD) phenotypes, including tangles density, TDP-43, and cognitive resilience. The deletion of this element was also linked to lower TMEM106B protein abundance. We also found a 22-kb deletion associated with depression in ROS/MAP and bearing similar association patterns as GWAS SNPs at the IQCK locus. In addition, we leveraged our catalog of SV-GWAS to replicate and characterize independent findings in SV-based GWAS for AD and five other neurodegenerative diseases. Among these findings, we highlight the replication of genome-wide significant SVs for progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), including markers for the 17q21.31 MAPT locus inversion and a 1483-bp deletion at the CYP2A13 locus, along with other suggestive associations, such as a 994-bp duplication in the LMNTD1 locus, suggestively linked to AD and a 3958-bp deletion at the DOCK5 locus linked to Lewy body disease (LBD) (P = 3.36 × 10 CONCLUSIONS: While still limited in sample size, this study highlights the utility of including analysis of SVs for elucidating mechanisms underlying GWAS loci and provides a valuable resource for the characterization of the effects of SVs in neurodegenerative disease pathogenesis.

Human herpesvirus-associated transposable element activation in human aging brains with Alzheimer's disease.	INTRODUCTION: Human herpesvirus (HHV) has been linked to Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. METHODS: We leveraged functional genomics data from Religious Orders Study or the Rush Memory and Aging Project (ROS/MAP) and Mount Sinai Brain Bank (MSBB) brain biobanks and single-cell RNA-sequencing data from HHV-infected forebrain organoids to investigate HHV-infection-associated transposable element (TE) dysregulation underlying AD etiologies. RESULTS: We identified widespread TE dysregulation in HHV-positive human AD brains, including an astrocyte-specific upregulation of LINE1 subfamily TEs in HHV-positive human AD brains. We further pinpointed astrocyte-specific LINE1 upregulation that could potentially regulate target gene NEAT1 expression via long-range enhancer-promoter chromatin interactions. This LINE1 dysregulation can be partially reversed by the usage of anti-HHV drugs (valacyclovir and acyclovir) in a virus-infected human brain organoid model. Finally, we demonstrated that valacyclovir rescued tau-associated neuropathology and alleviated LINE1 activation in an experimental tau aggregation model. DISCUSSION: Our analysis provides associations linking molecular, clinical, and neuropathological AD features with HHV infection, which warrants future clinical validation. HIGHLIGHTS: Via analysis of bulk RNA-seq data in two large-scale human brain biobanks, ROS/MAP (n = 109 pathologically confirmed AD and n = 44 cognitively healthy controls) and MSBB (n = 284 AD and n = 150 cognitively healthy controls), we identified widespread TE activation in HHV-positive human AD brains and significantly positive associations of HHV RNA abundance with APOE4 genotype, Braak staging score, and CERAD score. We identified cell type-specific LINE1 upregulation in both microglia and astrocytes of human AD brains via long-range enhancer-promoter chromatin interactions on lncRNA nuclear enriched abundant transcript 1 (NEAT1). We determined that usage of valacyclovir and acyclovir was significantly associated with reduced incidence of AD in a large real-world patient database. Using the HEK293 tau P301S model and U2OS mt-Keima cell model, we determined that valacyclovir treatment rescued tau-associated neuropathology and alleviated activation of LINE1 with increased cellular autophagy-level mechanistically supported clinical benefits of valacyclovir in real-world patient data.

Integrating Bulk and Single-Cell Transcriptomic Data to Identify Ferroptosis-Associated Inflammatory Gene in Alzheimer's Disease.	BACKGROUND: Ferroptosis is a form of programmed cell death triggered by iron-dependent lipid peroxidation, characterized by iron accumulation and elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to cell membrane damage. It is associated with a variety of diseases. However, the cellular and molecular links between ferroptosis, immune inflammation, and the brain-peripheral blood axis in Alzheimer's disease (AD) remain unclear. METHODS: We integrated bulk RNA-seq data from AD brain tissue and peripheral blood and refined the screening of AD candidate genes through differential gene expression analysis, weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), and other approaches. Additionally, we analyzed single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data from AD patients' brain tissue and peripheral blood, combined with scRNA-seq data from experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mouse brain tissue. This enabled us to explore AD-related molecular mechanisms from a cell-type-specific perspective. Finally, candidate genes were validated in ferroptosis models using reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) and immunofluorescence methods. RESULTS: Bulk RNA-seq analysis identified SLC11A1, an inflammatory gene associated with AD. Single-cell RNA-seq analysis further revealed that SLC11A1 expression was significantly elevated in the pro-inflammatory (M1-type) microglia and peripheral blood monocytes in AD. Moreover, we identified a microglial subpopulation in AD M1-type microglia that was highly associated with ferroptosis. This subpopulation simultaneously expressed characteristic markers of peripheral blood monocytes, suggesting that these cells may originate from peripheral blood monocytes, thereby triggering neuroinflammation through the ferroptosis pathway. Cell experiments confirmed that SLC11A1 was significantly upregulated in inflammatory microglia induced by ferroptosis. CONCLUSION: This study reveals the key role of SLC11A1 in AD, particularly in the context of ferroptosis and immune inflammation. It provides a novel molecular mechanistic perspective and offers potential targets for future therapeutic strategies.	Alzheimer’s disease; SLC11A1; ferroptosis; microglia; single-cell RNA sequencing

Mitochondrial Alterations, Oxidative Stress, and Therapeutic Implications in Alzheimer's Disease: A Narrative Review.	The relationship between aging, mitochondrial dysfunction, neurodegeneration, and the onset of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex area of study. Aging is the primary risk factor for AD, and it is associated with a decline in mitochondrial function. This mitochondrial dysfunction is believed to contribute to the neurodegenerative processes observed in AD. Neurodegeneration in AD is characterized by the progressive loss of synapses and neurons, particularly in regions of the brain involved in memory and cognition. It is hypothesized that mitochondrial dysfunction plays a pivotal role by disrupting cellular energy metabolism and increasing the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which can damage cellular components and exacerbate neuronal loss. Despite extensive research, the precise molecular pathways linking mitochondrial dysfunction to AD pathology are not fully understood. Various hypotheses have been proposed, including the mitochondrial cascade hypothesis, which suggests that mitochondrial dysfunction is an early event in AD pathogenesis that triggers a cascade of cellular events leading to neurodegeneration. With this narrative review, we aim to summarize some specific issues in the literature on mitochondria and their involvement in AD onset, with a focus on the development of therapeutical strategies targeting the mitochondria environment and their potential application for the treatment of AD itself.

Review of Associations of Diabetes and Insulin Resistance With Brain Health in Three Harmonised Cohort Studies of Ageing and Dementia.	Diabetes increases the risk of dementia, and insulin resistance (IR) has emerged as a potential unifying feature. Here, we review published findings over the past 2 decades on the relation of diabetes and IR to brain health, including those related to cognition and neuropathology, in the Religious Orders Study, the Rush Memory and Aging Project, and the Minority Aging Research Study (ROS/MAP/MARS), three harmonised cohort studies of ageing and dementia at the Rush Alzheimer's Disease Center (RADC). A wide range of participant data, including information on medical conditions such as diabetes and neuropsychological tests, as well as other clinical and laboratory-based data collected annually. Neuropathology data are collected in participants who agree to autopsy at death. Recent studies have measured additional peripheral and brain IR data, including multi-omics. This review summarises findings from the RADC cohort studies that investigate the relation of diabetes and IR in older adults to cognition, neuropathology, omics in dementia, and other brain health measures. Examining the risk of clinically diagnosed dementia in older adults, our study found a 65% increased risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia in individuals with diabetes compared with those without. Regarding cognitive function, we have consistently observed associations of diabetes, as well as both peripheral and brain IR, with worse and declining performance in global cognition and specific cognitive domains, particularly semantic memory and perceptual speed. Studies utilising neuropathological data showed associations of diabetes and peripheral IR with brain infarcts, while brain IR measures, notably alpha serine/threonine-protein kinase1 (AKT1), were associated with both brain infarcts and AD pathology. Multi-omics studies suggested shared causal genes and pathways between diabetes and dementia. Recent epigenetic studies have revealed associations between IR and AD risk, along with distinct 5-hydroxymethylcytosine signatures in diabetes-associated AD. Furthermore, our studies have utilised other available data to investigate the impact of diabetes on neurological outcomes other than cognition and reported worsening of parkinsonian-like signs in diabetes. Recent studies have also explored risk factors for diabetes and have reported associations between lower literacy and decision-making abilities with elevated haemoglobin A1C levels, a peripheral IR measure. Overall, our findings, as summarised in this review, illustrate a range of mechanistic and other insights into the complex relationship of diabetes and IR with brain health. These findings may have important implications for future research on the ageing brain, including the prevention of cognitive decline and dementia in persons at risk for or with diabetes.

ZNF398/ZER6 belongs to the Krüppel-associated box (KRAB) domain-containing zinc finger proteins (K-ZNFs), the largest family of transcriptional repressors in higher organisms. ZER6 exists in two isoforms, p52 and p71, generated through alternative splicing. Our investigation revealed that p71-ZER6 is abundantly expressed in the stomach, kidney, liver, heart, and brown adipose tissue, while p52-ZER6 is predominantly found in the stomach and brain. The role of p52-ZER6 in neurons has remained unclear. Leveraging open-source RNA-seq data, we identified metallothionein 3 (MT3) as a target gene of p52-ZER6 in mouse hippocampal neuronal HT-22 cells. Through chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, we identified the putative DNA-binding motif (CTAGGGGGGTTGTTATCTCTTTGG) of p52-ZER6 in the promoter region of MT3. Furthermore, we demonstrated an interaction between p52-ZER6 and estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) in the nucleus of SH-SY5Y cells, which led to the inhibition of p52-ZER6's DNA occupancy on the promoter of the MT3 gene. MT3 is a cysteine-rich, low molecular-weight protein known for reducing oxidative stress, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and metal toxicity. Our study revealed that overexpression of p52-ZER6 reduced the levels of MT3, increasing ROS levels, which was mitigated by co-overexpression of ERα. Notably, we also observed upregulation of p52-ZER6 and reduction of MT3 in the cortex of 5xFAD, an Alzheimer's disease (AD) mouse model. These findings suggest a potential pathological mechanism involving p52-ZER6-mediated ROS production in AD pathogenesis.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder globally, with no effective treatment available yet. A crucial pathological hallmark of AD is the accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau protein, which is deteriorated by reactive oxygen species (ROS) and neuroinflammation in AD progression. Thus, alleviation of ROS and inflammation has become a potential therapeutic strategy in many studies. Herein, we reported ultrasmall coordination polymer nanoparticles formed by ferric ions and gallic acid (Fe-GA CPNs), which owned antioxidant and anti-inflammation properties for AD therapeutics. The facilely prepared Fe-GA CPNs exhibited remarkable superoxide dismutase-like, peroxidase-like enzyme activity, and ROS eliminating ability with great water solubility, compared with gallic acid. We demonstrated that Fe-GA CPNs effectively relieved oxidative stress, ameliorated inflammation by modulating microglial polarization towards anti-inflammation phenotype, and reduced hyperphosphorylated tau protein levels. Furthermore, Fe-GA CPNs treatment significantly improved cognitive function in tauopathy-induced AD rats, and achieved a neuroprotective effect against AD pathology. This study highlights the potential of coordination polymer nanoparticles as promising therapeutic candidates for AD and other tau-related neurodegenerative diseases.

Neuropathology-based approach reveals novel Alzheimer's Disease genes and highlights female-specific pathways and causal links to disrupted lipid metabolism: insights into a vicious cycle.	Dementia refers to an umbrella phenotype of many different underlying pathologies with Alzheimer's disease (AD) being the most common type. Neuropathological examination remains the gold standard for accurate AD diagnosis, however, most that we know about AD genetics is based on Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) of clinically defined AD. Such studies have identified multiple AD susceptibility variants with a significant portion of the heritability unexplained and highlighting the phenotypic and genetic heterogeneity of the clinically defined entity. Furthermore, despite women's increased susceptibility to dementia, there is a lack of sex-specific genetic studies and understanding of sex-specific background for the disorder. Here, we aim to tackle the heterogeneity of AD by specifically concentrating on neuropathological features and pursuing sex-specific analysis. We bring together 14 different genomic and neuropathology datasets (6960 individuals) and we integrate our GWAS findings with transcriptomic and phenotypic data aiming to also identify biomarkers for AD progression. We uncover novel genetic associations to AD neuropathology, including BIN1 and OPCML. Our sex-specific analysis points to a role for BIN1 specifically in women as well as novel AD loci including QRFPR and SGCZ. Post-GWAS analyses illuminate the functional and biological mechanisms underlying AD and reveal sex-specific differences. Finally, through PheWAS and Mendelian Randomization analysis, we identify causal links with AD neuropathology pointing to disrupted lipid metabolism, as well as impaired peripheral immune response and liver dysfunction as part of a vicious cycle that fuels neurodegeneration.

Integrated network pharmacology and transcriptomics to explore the mechanism of compound Dihuang granule (CDG) protects dopaminergic neurons by regulating the Nrf2/HMOX1 pathway in the 6-OHDA/MPP	BACKGROUND: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a degenerative neurological disease that worsens over time. Ferroptosis has been proven to contribute to PD pathogenesis. CDG exhibits neuroprotective effects. However, CDG's potential mechanism in PD therapy remains uncertain. PURPOSE: The purpose of this investigation is to ascertain the specific molecular mechanisms of CDG against neuronal ferroptosis and present an alternative option for PD management. METHODS: Network pharmacology along with LC-MS were used to identify possible targets and candidate pathways. Then RNA-sequencing combined in the in vitro and in vivo experiments were utilized to validate these findings. RESULTS: According to network pharmacology prediction, NFE2L2, HMOX1 and PTGS2 may be the key genes for ferroptosis in PD. In the in vivo experiments, CDG ultimately improved the neurobehavior of PD rats by alleviating the damage of dopamine neurons, decreasing the levels of MDA, ROS and Fe CONCLUSION: CDG has a neuroprotective involvement in alleviating ferroptosis by regulating the Nrf2/HMOX1 pathway. Moreover, this research offers pharmacological evidence supporting the applications of CDG for treating PD.	Compound Dihuang granules; Ferroptosis; Nrf2/HMOX1 pathway; Parkinson’s disease

Association of ten VEGF family genes with Alzheimer's disease endophenotypes at single cell resolution.	INTRODUCTION: Using a single-nucleus transcriptome derived from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of 424 Religious Orders Study and the Rush Memory and Aging Project (ROS/MAP) participants, we investigated the cell type-specific effect of ten vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) genes on Alzheimer's disease (AD) endophenotypes. METHODS: Negative binomial mixed models were used for differential gene expression and association analysis with AD endophenotypes. VEGF-associated intercellular communication was also profiled. RESULTS: Higher microglia FLT1, endothelial FLT4, and oligodendrocyte VEGFB are associated with greater amyloid beta (Aβ) load, whereas higher VEGFB expression in inhibitory neurons is associated with lower Aβ load. Higher astrocyte NRP1 is associated with lower tau density. Higher microglia and endothelial FLT1 are associated with worse cognition performance. Endothelial and microglial FLT1 expression was upregulated in clinical AD patients compared to cognitively normal controls. Finally, AD cells showed a significant reduction in VEGF signaling compared to controls. DISCUSSION: Our results highlight key changes in VEGF receptor expression in endothelial and microglial cells during AD, and the potential protective role of VEGFB in neurons. HIGHLIGHTS: The prefrontal cortical expression of FLT1 and FLT4 was associated with worse cross-sectional global cognitive function, longitudinal cognitive trajectories, and more Alzheimer's disease (AD) neuropathology. The associations between FLT1 or FLT4 and AD endophenotypes appear to be driven by endothelial and microglial cells. VEGFB expression seems to have opposing effects on the Aβ burden in AD depending on cell types, highlighting its potential protective role in neurons.

Pathologic and clinical correlates of region-specific brain GFAP in Alzheimer's disease.	Plasma glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) is an emerging biomarker of Alzheimer's disease (AD), with higher blood GFAP levels linked to faster cognitive decline, particularly among individuals with high brain amyloid burden. However, few studies have examined brain GFAP expression to clarify if peripheral associations reflect brain changes. This study aimed to correlate region-specific GFAP mRNA expression (n = 917) and protein abundance (n=386) with diverse neuropathological measures at autopsy in the Religious Orders Study and Rush Memory and Aging Project (ROS/MAP) and to characterize the interaction between brain GFAP and brain amyloid burden on downstream outcomes. We assessed GFAP gene expression in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, caudate nucleus, and posterior cingulate cortex with respect to core AD pathology (amyloid-β and tau), cerebrovascular (microinfarcts, macroinfarcts, and cerebral amyloid angiopathy [CAA]), proteinopathic (TDP-43, Lewy bodies), and cognitive outcomes. These associations were further examined at the protein level using tandem-mass tag proteomic measurements from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. We also assessed GFAP interactions with AD neuropathology on downstream outcomes. Cortical GFAP gene and protein expression were significantly upregulated in participants with a neuropathologically confirmed AD diagnosis at autopsy (all P	Alzheimer’s disease; Astrocytes; Biomarkers; GFAP; Proteomics; Transcriptomics

GWAS of multiple neuropathology endophenotypes identifies new risk loci and provides insights into the genetic risk of dementia.	Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified >80 Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD)-associated genetic loci. However, the clinical outcomes used in most previous studies belie the complex nature of underlying neuropathologies. Here we performed GWAS on 11 ADRD-related neuropathology endophenotypes with participants drawn from the following three sources: the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center, the Religious Orders Study and Rush Memory and Aging Project, and the Adult Changes in Thought study (n = 7,804 total autopsied participants). We identified eight independent significantly associated loci, of which four were new (COL4A1, PIK3R5, LZTS1 and APOC2). Separately testing known ADRD loci, 19 loci were significantly associated with at least one neuropathology after false-discovery rate adjustment. Genetic colocalization analyses identified pleiotropic effects and quantitative trait loci. Methylation in the cerebral cortex at two sites near APOC2 was associated with cerebral amyloid angiopathy. Studies that include neuropathology endophenotypes are an important step in understanding the mechanisms underlying genetic ADRD risk.

Melatonin rescues pregnant female mice and their juvenile offspring from high fat diet-induced alzheimer disease neuropathy.	High fat diet (HFD) is a prime factor, which contributes to the present epidemic of metabolic syndrome. Prolonged intake of HFD induces oxidative stress (OS) that in turn causes neuroinflammation, neurodegeneration, insulin resistance, amyloid burden, synaptic dysfunction and cognitive impairment hence leading to Alzheimer's disease neuropathy. Melatonin (secreted by the Pineal gland) has the potential to nullify the toxic effects of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and have been shown to ameliorate various complications induced by HFD in rodent models. This study aimed to assess the neurotherapeutic effects of melatonin on HFD-induced neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration mediated by OS in pregnant female mice and their offspring. Western blotting, immunohistochemistry and antioxidant enzyme assays were used for quantification of samples from the hippocampal region of the brain of pregnant albino mice and their offspring. Short- and long-term memory was assessed by Y-maze and Morris Water Maze tests. HFD significantly induced OS leading to AD like neuropathology in the pregnant mice and their offspring while melatonin administration simultaneously with the HFD significantly prevented this neuropathy. This study reports that melatonin exerts these effects through the stimulation of SIRT1/Nrf2/HO-1 pathway that in turn reduces the HFD-induced OS and its downstream signaling. In conclusion melatonin prevents HFD-induced multiple complications that ultimately leads to the memory dysfunction in pregnant female mice and their successive generation via activation of SIRT1/Nrf2 signaling pathway.

Cognitive resilience to Alzheimer's disease characterized by cell-type abundance.	INTRODUCTION: The molecular basis of cognitive resilience (CR) among pathologically confirmed Alzheimer's disease (AD) cases is not well understood. METHODS: Abundance of 13 cell types and neuronal subtypes in brain bulk RNA-seq data from the anterior caudate, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) obtained from 434 AD cases, 318 cognitively resilient AD cases, and 188 controls in the Religious Orders Study and Rush Memory and Aging Project was estimated by deconvolution. RESULTS: PVALB+ neuron abundance was negatively associated with cognitive status and tau pathology in the DLPFC and PCC (P DISCUSSION: High abundance of PVALB+ neurons may be a marker of CR. TMEM106B variants may influence CR independent of AD pathology. HIGHLIGHTS: Neuron retention and a lack of astrocytosis are highly predictive of Alzheimer's disease (AD) resilience. PVALB+ GABAergic and RORB+ glutamatergic neurons are associated with cognitive status. A TMEM106B single nucleotide polymorphism is related to lower AD risk, higher neuron count, and increased AD pathology.

Predicting Alzheimer's Cognitive Resilience Score: A Comparative Study of Machine Learning Models Using RNA-seq Data.	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an important research topic. While amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles are hallmark pathological features of AD, cognitive resilience (CR) is a phenomenon where cognitive function remains preserved despite the presence of these pathological features. This study aimed to construct and compare predictive machine learning models for CR scores using RNA-seq data from the Religious Orders Study and Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP) and Mount Sinai Brain Bank (MSBB) cohorts. We evaluated support vector regression (SVR), random forest, XGBoost, linear, and transformer-based models. The SVR model exhibited the best performance, with contributing genes identified using Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) scores, providing insights into biological pathways associated with CR. Finally, we developed a tool called the resilience gene analyzer (REGA), which visualizes SHAP scores to interpret the contributions of individual genes to CR.

Loneliness, cerebrovascular and Alzheimer's disease pathology, and cognition.	INTRODUCTION: Loneliness has a rising public health impact, but research involving neuropathology and representative cohorts has been limited. METHODS: Inverse odds of selection weights were generalized from the autopsy sample of Rush Alzheimer's Disease Center cohorts (N = 680; 89 ± 9 years old; 25% dementia) to the US-representative Health and Retirement Study (N = 8469; 76 ± 7 years old; 5% dementia) to extend external validity. Regressions tested cross-sectional associations between loneliness and (1) Alzheimer's disease (AD) and cerebrovascular pathology; (2) five cognitive domains; and (3) relationships between pathology and cognition, adjusting for depression. RESULTS: In weighted models, greater loneliness was associated with microinfarcts, lower episodic and working memory in the absence of AD pathology, lower working memory in the absence of infarcts, a stronger association of infarcts with lower episodic memory, and a stronger association of microinfarcts with lower working and semantic memory. DISCUSSION: Loneliness may relate to AD through multiple pathways involving cerebrovascular pathology and cognitive reserve. HIGHLIGHTS: Loneliness was associated with worse cognition in five domains. Loneliness was associated with the presence of microinfarcts. Loneliness moderated cognition-neuropathology associations. Transportability methods can provide insight into selection bias.

Mitochondrial complex III-derived ROS amplify immunometabolic changes in astrocytes and promote dementia pathology.	Neurodegenerative disorders alter mitochondrial functions, including the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Mitochondrial complex III (CIII) generates ROS implicated in redox signaling, but its triggers, targets, and disease relevance are not clear. Using site-selective suppressors and genetic manipulations together with mitochondrial ROS imaging and multiomic profiling, we found that CIII is the dominant source of ROS production in astrocytes exposed to neuropathology-related stimuli. Astrocytic CIII-ROS production was dependent on nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and the mitochondrial sodium-calcium exchanger (NCLX) and caused oxidation of select cysteines within immune and metabolism-associated proteins linked to neurological disease. CIII-ROS amplified metabolomic and pathology-associated transcriptional changes in astrocytes, with STAT3 activity as a major mediator, and facilitated neuronal toxicity in a non-cell-autonomous manner. As proof-of-concept, suppression of CIII-ROS in mice decreased dementia-linked tauopathy and neuroimmune cascades and extended lifespan. Our findings establish CIII-ROS as an important immunometabolic signal transducer and tractable therapeutic target in neurodegenerative disease.

Structural variants linked to Alzheimer's Disease and other common age-related clinical and neuropathologic traits.	Advances have led to a greater understanding of the genetics of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). However, the gap between the predicted and observed genetic heritability estimates when using single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and small indel data remains. Large genomic rearrangements, known as structural variants (SVs), have the potential to account for this missing genetic heritability. By leveraging data from two ongoing cohort studies of aging and dementia, the Religious Orders Study and Rush Memory and Aging Project (ROS/MAP), we performed genome-wide association analysis testing around 20,000 common SVs from 1,088 participants with whole genome sequencing (WGS) data. A range of Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders (AD/ADRD) clinical and pathologic traits were examined. Given the limited sample size, no genome-wide significant association was found, but we mapped SVs across 81 AD risk loci and discovered 22 SVs in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with GWAS lead variants and directly associated with AD/ADRD phenotypes (nominal

Chinese medicine PaBing-II protects human iPSC-derived dopaminergic neurons from oxidative stress.	BACKGROUND: PaBing-II Formula (PB-II) is a traditional Chinese medicine for treating Parkinson's disease (PD). However, owing to the complexity of PB-II and the difficulty in obtaining human dopaminergic neurons (DAn), the mechanism of action of PB-II in PD treatment remains unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanisms underlying the therapeutic benefits of PB-II in patients with PD. METHODS: hiPSCs derived DAn were treated with H CONCLUSION: PB-II significantly protects DAn from inflammation and oxidative stress via Nrf2 pathway activation. These findings elucidate the roles of PB-II in PD treatment and demonstrate the application of hiPSC-derived DAn in research of Chinese medicine.

Traffic-related ultrafine particles impair mitochondrial functions in human olfactory mucosa cells - Implications for Alzheimer's disease.	Constituents of air pollution, the ultrafine particles (UFP) with a diameter of ≤0.1 μm, are considerably related to traffic emissions. Several studies link air pollution to Alzheimer's disease (AD), yet the exact relationship between the two remains poorly understood. Mitochondria are known targets of environmental toxicants, and their dysfunction is associated with neurodegenerative diseases. The olfactory mucosa (OM), located at the rooftop of the nasal cavity, is directly exposed to the environment and in contact with the brain. Mounting evidence suggests that the UFPs can impact the brain directly through the olfactory tract. By using primary human OM cultures established from nasal biopsies of cognitively healthy controls and individuals diagnosed with AD, we aimed to decipher the effects of traffic-related UFPs on mitochondria. The UFP samples were collected from the exhausts of a modern heavy-duty diesel engine (HDE) without aftertreatment systems, run with renewable diesel (A0) and petroleum diesel (A20), and from an engine of a 2019 model diesel passenger car (DI-E6d) equipped with state-of-the-art aftertreatment devices and run with renewable diesel (Euro6). OM cells were exposed to three different UFPs for 24-h and 72-h, after which cellular processes were assessed on the functional and transcriptomic levels. Our results show that UFPs impair mitochondrial functions in primary human OM cells by hampering oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and redox balance, and the responses of AD cells differ from cognitively healthy controls. RNA-Seq and IPA® revealed inhibition of OXPHOS and mitochondrial dysfunction in response to UFPs A0 and A20. Functional validation confirmed that A0 and A20 impair cellular respiration, decrease ATP levels, and disturb redox balance by altering NAD and glutathione metabolism, leading to increased ROS and oxidative stress. RNA-Seq and functional assessment revealed the presence of AD-related alterations in human OM cells and that different fuels and engine technologies elicit differential effects.

Associations of renin-angiotensin system inhibitor use with brain insulin signaling and neuropathology.	OBJECTIVE: To examine the associations of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitor use with postmortem brain insulin signaling and neuropathology. METHODS: Among Religious Orders Study participants, 150 deceased and autopsied older individuals (75 with diabetes matched to 75 without by age at death, sex, and education) had measurements of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) and RAC-alpha serine/threonine protein kinase (AKT1) collected in the prefrontal cortex using ELISA and immunohistochemistry. Alzheimer's disease (AD), brain infarcts, and cerebral vessel pathology data were assessed by systematic neuropathologic evaluations. RAS inhibitor use was determined based on visual inspection of medication containers during study visits. The associations of RAS inhibitor use with brain insulin signaling measures and neuropathology were examined using adjusted regression analyses. RESULTS: Of the 90 RAS inhibitor users (54 with diabetes), 65 had used only angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, 11 only angiotensin II receptor blockers, and 14 used both. RAS inhibitor use was associated with lower pT INTERPRETATION: Late-life RAS inhibitor use may be associated with lower brain AKT1 phosphorylation and fewer neurofibrillary tangles.

Platelet activation of protease-activated receptor 4 (PAR4) and thrombin are at the top of a chain of events leading to fibrin deposition, microinfarcts, blood-brain barrier disruption, and inflammation. We evaluated mRNA expression of the PAR4 gene F2RL3 in human brain and global cognitive performance in participants with and without cognitive impairment or dementia. Data were acquired from the Religious Orders Study (ROS) and the Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP). F2RL3 mRNA was elevated in AD cases and was associated with worse retrospective longitudinal cognitive performance. Moreover, F2RL3 expression interacted with clinical AD diagnosis on longitudinal cognition whereas this relationship was attenuated in individuals without cognitive impairment. Additionally, when adjusting for the effects of AD neuropathology, F2RL3 expression remained a significant predictor of cognitive decline. F2RL3 expression correlated positively with transcript levels of proinflammatory markers including TNFα, IL-1β, NFκB, and fibrinogen α/β/γ. Together, these results reveal that F2RL3 mRNA expression is associated with multiple AD-relevant outcomes and its encoded product, PAR4, may play a role in disease pathogenesis.

Association of Alzheimer's Disease and Other Neuropathologies With Functional Disability in Persons With and Without Dementia.	BACKGROUND: Dementia results from multiple neuropathologies causing cognitive impairment sufficiently severe to affect functional status. However, these pathologies and functional impairment are common in persons without dementia. We examined the association of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and multiple other neuropathologies with instrumental and basic activities of daily living in persons with and without dementia. METHODS: Participants were 1 509 deceased from the Religious Orders Study or Rush Memory and Aging Project. Pathologic AD and 3 other AD indices were examined, in addition to 4 non-AD neurodegenerative pathologies: cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), hippocampal sclerosis, TDP-43, and Lewy bodies, and 4 cerebrovascular pathologies: gross- and microinfarctions, athero- and arteriolosclerosis. Functional assessment included Lawton and Katz Index Instrumental and Basic Activities of Daily Living (IADL and BADL). Ordinal regression models adjusted for age, sex, and education were used to examine the association of neuropathologies with IADL and BADL. RESULTS: Alzheimer's disease and the other neuropathologies were associated with impaired IADL (all ps < .001) and with impaired BADL (ps < .01), except for atherosclerosis and CAA, which were not associated with BADL. The effects of most neuropathologies were largely affected by dementia. However, small effects on IADL remained for PHF-tau tangles after adjusting models for dementia. Direct effects of gross infarcts on IADL and BADL and of microinfarcts on BADL remained unchanged after adjusting the models for dementia. CONCLUSIONS: Alzheimer's disease and all other neuropathologies are strongly associated with functional disability. The association of most neuropathologies with disability was eliminated or attenuated by dementia, except for gross infarcts and microinfarcts.

Mdivi-1, Mitochondrial DIVIsion inhibitor 1, has been widely employed in research under the assumption that it exclusively influences mitochondrial fusion, but effects other than mitochondrial dynamics have been underinvestigated. This paper provides transcriptome and DNA methylome-wide analysis for Mdivi-1 treated SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and methyl capture sequencing (MC-seq) methods. Gene ontology analysis of RNA sequences revealed that p53 transcriptional gene network and DNA replication initiation-related genes were significantly up and down-regulated, respectively, showing the correlation with the arrest cell cycle in the G1 phase. MC-seq, a powerful sequencing method for capturing DNA methylation status in CpG sites, revealed that although Mdivi-1 does not induce dramatic DNA methylation change, the subtle alterations were concentrated within the CpG island. Integrative analysis of both sequencing data disclosed that the p53 transcriptional network was activated while the Parkinson's disease pathway was halted. Next, we investigated several changes in mitochondria in response to Mdivi-1. Copy number and transcription of mitochondrial DNA were suppressed. ROS levels increased, and elevated ROS triggered mitochondrial retrograde signaling rather than inducing direct DNA damage. In this study, we could better understand the molecular network of Mdivi-1 by analyzing DNA methylation and mRNA transcription in the nucleus and further investigating various changes in mitochondria, providing inspiration for studying nuclear-mitochondrial communications.

Genetic associations with dementia-related proteinopathy: Application of item response theory.	INTRODUCTION: Although dementia-related proteinopathy has a strong negative impact on public health, and is highly heritable, understanding of the related genetic architecture is incomplete. METHODS: We applied multidimensional generalized partial credit modeling (GPCM) to test genetic associations with dementia-related proteinopathies. Data were analyzed to identify candidate single nucleotide variants for the following proteinopathies: Aβ, tau, α-synuclein, and TDP-43. RESULTS: Final included data comprised 966 participants with neuropathologic and WGS data. Three continuous latent outcomes were constructed, corresponding to TDP-43-, Aβ/Tau-, and α-synuclein-related neuropathology endophenotype scores. This approach helped validate known genotype/phenotype associations: for example, TMEM106B and GRN were risk alleles for TDP-43 pathology; and GBA for α-synuclein/Lewy bodies. Novel suggestive proteinopathy-linked alleles were also discovered, including several (SDHAF1, TMEM68, and ARHGEF28) with colocalization analyses and/or high degrees of biologic credibility. DISCUSSION: A novel methodology using GPCM enabled insights into gene candidates for driving misfolded proteinopathies. HIGHLIGHTS: Latent factor scores for proteinopathies were estimated using a generalized partial credit model. The three latent continuous scores corresponded well with proteinopathy severity. Novel genes associated with proteinopathies were identified. Several genes had high degrees of biologic credibility for dementia risk factors.

CHRNA5 links chandelier cells to severity of amyloid pathology in aging and Alzheimer's disease.	Changes in high-affinity nicotinic acetylcholine receptors are intricately connected to neuropathology in Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Protective and cognitive-enhancing roles for the nicotinic α5 subunit have been identified, but this gene has not been closely examined in the context of human aging and dementia. Therefore, we investigate the nicotinic α5 gene CHRNA5 and the impact of relevant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in prefrontal cortex from 922 individuals with matched genotypic and post-mortem RNA sequencing in the Religious Orders Study and Memory and Aging Project (ROS/MAP). We find that a genotype robustly linked to increased expression of CHRNA5 (rs1979905A2) predicts significantly reduced cortical β-amyloid load. Intriguingly, co-expression analysis suggests CHRNA5 has a distinct cellular expression profile compared to other nicotinic receptor genes. Consistent with this prediction, single nucleus RNA sequencing from 22 individuals reveals CHRNA5 expression is disproportionately elevated in chandelier neurons, a distinct subtype of inhibitory neuron known for its role in excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) balance. We show that chandelier neurons are enriched in amyloid-binding proteins compared to basket cells, the other major subtype of PVALB-positive interneurons. Consistent with the hypothesis that nicotinic receptors in chandelier cells normally protect against β-amyloid, cell-type proportion analysis from 549 individuals reveals these neurons show amyloid-associated vulnerability only in individuals with impaired function/trafficking of nicotinic α5-containing receptors due to homozygosity of the missense CHRNA5 SNP (rs16969968A2). Taken together, these findings suggest that CHRNA5 and its nicotinic α5 subunit exert a neuroprotective role in aging and Alzheimer's disease centered on chandelier interneurons.

Human iPSC-derived retinal organoids develop robust Alzheimer's disease neuropathology.	Alzheimer's disease (AD), characterized by memory loss and cognitive decline, affects nearly 50 million people worldwide. Amyloid beta (Aβ) plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) of phosphorylated Tau protein (pTau) are key histopathological features of the disease in the brain, and recent advances have also identified AD histopathology in the retina. Thus, the retina represents a central nervous system (CNS) tissue highly amenable to non-invasive diagnostic imaging that shows promise as a biomarker for early AD. Given the devastating effects of AD on patients, their families, and society, new treatment modalities that can significantly alter the disease course are urgently needed. In this study, we have developed and characterized a novel human retinal organoid (RO) model derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from patients with familial AD due to mutations in the amyloid precursor protein gene (APP). Using immunofluorescence and histological staining, we evaluated the cellular composition and AD histopathological features of AD-ROs compared to control ROs from healthy individuals. We found that AD-ROs largely resemble their healthy control counterparts in cellular composition but display increased levels of Aβ and pTau. We also present proof of principle of an assay to quantify amyloid levels in whole ROs. This	Alzheimer’s disease; disease modeling; hiPSC; organoid; retina

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's dementia (AD) pathogenesis involves complex mechanisms, including microRNA (miRNA) dysregulation. Integrative network and machine learning analysis of miRNA can provide insights into AD pathology and prognostic/diagnostic biomarkers. METHODS: We performed co-expression network analysis to identify network modules associated with AD, its neuropathology markers, and cognition using brain tissue miRNA profiles from the Religious Orders Study and Rush Memory and Aging Project (ROS/MAP) (N = 702) as a discovery dataset. We performed association analysis of hub miRNAs with AD, its neuropathology markers, and cognition. After selecting target genes of the hub miRNAs, we performed association analysis of the hub miRNAs with their target genes and then performed pathway-based enrichment analysis. For replication, we performed a consensus miRNA co-expression network analysis using the ROS/MAP dataset and an independent dataset (N = 16) from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). Furthermore, we performed a machine learning approach to assess the performance of hub miRNAs for AD classification. RESULTS: Network analysis identified a glucose metabolism pathway-enriched module (M3) as significantly associated with AD and cognition. Five hub miRNAs (miR-129-5p, miR-433, miR-1260, miR-200a, and miR-221) of M3 had significant associations with AD clinical and/or pathologic traits, with miR129-5p by far the strongest across all phenotypes. Gene-set enrichment analysis of target genes associated with their corresponding hub miRNAs identified significantly enriched biological pathways including ErbB, AMPK, MAPK, and mTOR signaling pathways. Consensus network analysis identified two AD-associated consensus network modules and two hub miRNAs (miR-129-5p and miR-221). Machine learning analysis showed that the AD classification performance (area under the curve (AUC) = 0.807) of age, sex, and APOE ε4 carrier status was significantly improved by 6.3% with inclusion of five AD-associated hub miRNAs. CONCLUSIONS: Integrative network and machine learning analysis identified miRNA signatures, especially miR-129-5p, as associated with AD, its neuropathology markers, and cognition, enhancing our understanding of AD pathogenesis and leading to better performance of AD classification as potential diagnostic/prognostic biomarkers.

Human disease-specific cell signatures in non-lesional tissue in Multiple Sclerosis detected by single-cell and spatial transcriptomics.	"Recent investigations of cell type changes in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) using single-cell profiling methods have focused on active lesional and peri-lesional brain tissue, and have implicated a number of peripheral and central nervous system cell types. However, an important question is the extent to which so-called ""normal-appearing"" non-lesional tissue in individuals with MS accumulate changes over the lifespan. Here, we compared post-mortem non-lesional brain tissue from donors with a pathological or clinical diagnosis of MS from the Religious Orders Study or Rush Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP) cohorts to age- and sex-matched brains from persons without MS (controls). We profiled three brain regions using single-nucleus RNA-seq: dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), normal appearing white matter (NAWM) and the pulvinar in thalamus (PULV), from 15 control individuals, 8 individuals with MS, and 5 individuals with other detrimental pathologies accompanied by demyelination, resulting in a total of 78 samples. We identified region- and cell type-specific differences in non-lesional samples from individuals diagnosed with MS and/or exhibiting secondary demyelination with other neurological conditions, as compared to control donors. These differences included lower proportions of oligodendrocytes with expression of myelination related genes MOBP, MBP, PLP1, as well as higher proportions of CRYAB+ oligodendrocytes in all three brain regions. Among microglial signatures, we identified subgroups that were higher in both demyelination (TMEM163+/ERC2+), as well as those that were specifically higher in MS donors (HIF1A+/SPP1+) and specifically in donors with secondary demyelination (SOCS6+/MYO1E+), in both white and grey matter. To validate our findings, we generated Visium spatial transcriptomics data on matched tissue from 13 donors, and recapitulated our observations of gene expression differences in oligodendrocytes and microglia. Finally, we show that some of the differences observed between control and MS donors in NAWM mirror those previously reported between control WM and active lesions in MS donors. Overall, our investigation sheds additional light on cell type- and disease-specific differences present even in non-lesional white and grey matter tissue, highlighting widespread cellular signatures that may be associated with downstream pathological changes."

Effects of copy number variations on longevity in late-onset Alzheimer's disease patients: insights from a causality network analysis.	Alzheimer's disease (AD), particularly late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD), is a prevalent form of dementia that significantly affects patients' cognitive and behavioral capacities and longevity. Although approximately 70 genetic risk factors linked with AD have been identified, their influence on patient longevity remains unclear. Further, recent studies have associated copy number variations (CNVs) with the longevity of healthy individuals and immune-related pathways in AD patients. This study aims to investigate the role of CNVs on the longevity of AD patients by integrating the Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) and transcriptomics data from the Religious Orders Study/Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP) cohort through causality network inference. Our comprehensive analysis led to the construction of a CNV-Gene-Age of Death (AOD) causality network. We successfully identified three key CNVs (DEL5006, mCNV14192, and DUP42180) and seven AD-longevity causal genes (	Alzheimer’s disease; causality network; copy number variation; longevity; plasminogen activation

Integrative multi-omics analysis reveals the critical role of the PBXIP1 gene in Alzheimer's disease.	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder, and its strongest risk factor is aging. A few studies have explored the relationship between aging and AD, while the underlying mechanism remains unclear. We assembled data across multi-omics (i.e., epigenetics, transcriptomics, and proteomics, based on frozen tissues from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) and neuropathological and clinical traits from the Religious Orders Study and Rush Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP). Aging was assessed using six DNA methylation clocks (including the Horvath clock, Hannum clock, Levine clock, HorvathSkin clock, Lin clock, and Cortical clock) that capture mortality risk in literature. After accounting for age, we first identified a gene module (including 263 genes) that was related to the integrated aging measure of six clocks, as well as three neuropathological traits of AD (i.e., β-amyloid, Tau tangles, and tangle density). Interestingly, among 20 key genes with top intramodular connectivity of the module, PBXIP1 was the only one that was significantly associated with all three neuropathological traits of AD at the protein level after Bonferroni correction. Furthermore, PBXIP1 was associated with the clinical diagnosis of AD in both ROSMAP and three independent datasets. Moreover, PBXIP1 may be related to AD through its role in astrocytes and hippocampal neurons, and the mTOR pathway. The results suggest the critical role of PBXIP1 in AD and support the potential and feasibility of using multi-omics data to investigate mechanisms of complex diseases. However, more validations in different populations and experiments in vitro and in vivo are required in the future.

High-throughput digital quantification of Alzheimer disease pathology and associated infrastructure in large autopsy studies.	High-throughput digital pathology offers considerable advantages over traditional semiquantitative and manual methods of counting pathology. We used brain tissue from 5 clinical-pathologic cohort studies of aging; the Religious Orders Study, the Rush Memory and Aging Project, the Minority Aging Research Study, the African American Clinical Core, and the Latino Core to (1) develop a workflow management system for digital pathology processes, (2) optimize digital algorithms to quantify Alzheimer disease (AD) pathology, and (3) harmonize data statistically. Data from digital algorithms for the quantification of β-amyloid (Aβ, n = 413) whole slide images and tau-tangles (n = 639) were highly correlated with manual pathology data (r = 0.83 to 0.94). Measures were robust and reproducible across different magnifications and repeated scans. Digital measures for Aβ and tau-tangles across multiple brain regions reproduced established patterns of correlations, even when samples were stratified by clinical diagnosis. Finally, we harmonized newly generated digital measures with historical measures across multiple large autopsy-based studies. We describe a multidisciplinary approach to develop a digital pathology pipeline that reproducibly identifies AD neuropathologies, Aβ load, and tau-tangles. Digital pathology is a powerful tool that can overcome critical challenges associated with traditional microscopy methods.

Multi-tissue epigenetic analysis identifies distinct associations underlying insulin resistance and Alzheimer's disease at CPT1A locus.	BACKGROUND: Insulin resistance (IR) is a major risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia. The mechanisms by which IR predisposes to AD are not well-understood. Epigenetic studies may help identify molecular signatures of IR associated with AD, thus improving our understanding of the biological and regulatory mechanisms linking IR and AD. METHODS: We conducted an epigenome-wide association study of IR, quantified using the homeostatic model assessment of IR (HOMA-IR) and adjusted for body mass index, in 3,167 participants from the Framingham Heart Study (FHS) without type 2 diabetes at the time of blood draw used for methylation measurement. We identified DNA methylation markers associated with IR at the genome-wide level accounting for multiple testing (P < 1.1 × 10 RESULTS: We confirmed the strong association of blood DNA methylation with IR at three loci (cg17901584-DHCR24, cg17058475-CPT1A, cg00574958-CPT1A, and cg06500161-ABCG1). In FHS, higher levels of blood DNA methylation at cg00574958 and cg17058475 were both associated with lower IR (P = 2.4 × 10 CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest potentially distinct epigenetic regulatory mechanisms between peripheral blood and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex tissues underlying IR and AD at CPT1A locus.

Evaluating genomic signatures of aging in brain tissue as it relates to Alzheimer's disease.	Telomere length (TL) attrition, epigenetic age acceleration, and mitochondrial DNA copy number (mtDNAcn) decline are established hallmarks of aging. Each has been individually associated with Alzheimer's dementia, cognitive function, and pathologic Alzheimer's disease (AD). Epigenetic age and mtDNAcn have been studied in brain tissue directly but prior work on TL in brain is limited to small sample sizes and most studies have examined leukocyte TL. Importantly, TL, epigenetic age clocks, and mtDNAcn have not been studied jointly in brain tissue from an AD cohort. We examined dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) tissue from N = 367 participants of the Religious Orders Study (ROS) or the Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP). TL and mtDNAcn were estimated from whole genome sequencing (WGS) data and cortical clock age was computed on 347 CpG sites. We examined dementia, MCI, and level of and change in cognition, pathologic AD, and three quantitative AD traits, as well as measures of other neurodegenerative diseases and cerebrovascular diseases (CVD). We previously showed that mtDNAcn from DLPFC brain tissue was associated with clinical and pathologic features of AD. Here, we show that those associations are independent of TL. We found TL to be associated with β-amyloid levels (beta = - 0.15, p = 0.023), hippocampal sclerosis (OR = 0.56, p = 0.0015) and cerebral atherosclerosis (OR = 1.44, p = 0.0007). We found strong associations between mtDNAcn and clinical measures of AD. The strongest associations with pathologic measures of AD were with cortical clock and there were associations of mtDNAcn with global AD pathology and tau tangles. Of the other pathologic traits, mtDNAcn was associated with hippocampal sclerosis, macroscopic infarctions and CAA and cortical clock was associated with Lewy bodies. Multi-modal age acceleration, accelerated aging on both mtDNAcn and cortical clock, had greater effect size than a single measure alone. These findings highlight for the first time that age acceleration determined on multiple genomic measures, mtDNAcn and cortical clock may have a larger effect on AD/AD related disorders (ADRD) pathogenesis than single measures.

BACKGROUND: The Qiji Shujiang granule (QJG) is a traditional Chinese drug widely used in treating PD patients. However, the potential mechanism of QJG in PD therapy is still unclear. PURPOSE: This study aims to examine the neuroprotective effects of QJG and the specific mechanism by which QJG alleviates MPTP/Probenecid-induced pyroptosis and offers an alternative for PD treatment. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We first employed network pharmacology along with molecular docking to identify potential molecular targets and pathways. Subsequently, we validated our findings of RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis and experiments in vivo and vitro. Lentiviral systems and inhibitors were used for experiments. RESULTS: The protein-protein interactions (PPI) core genes network consists of NLRP3, CASP1 (caspase-1), TP53, and MAPK8. Pathway enrichment analysis revealed that inflammatory responses related to pyroptosis were significantly enriched. The molecular docking findings showed the highest degree of centrality regarding the top three bioactive compounds following the online database. RNA-seq analysis identified that NLRP3 inflammasome was significantly downregulated in the QJG group while it was significantly upregulated in the model group. Our findings revealed that QJG dose-dependently increased the total traveled distances, enhanced the dopaminergic neurons, and accelerated the restoration of the TH protein level, showing a good antioxidant capacity through increasing the SOD levels and decreasing MDA levels. QJG significantly reduced the expression levels of NLRP3, GSDMD-N, IL-1β, and caspase-1 in striatum tissue. Furthermore, the group treated with OE-NLRP3 decreased cell viability, increased ROS and MDA levels, and promoted NLRP3, GSDMD-N, and caspase-1, in addition to IL-1β expression levels. Furthermore, OE-NLRP3+QJG treatment significantly reversed the effect. In vivo experiments, QJG dose-dependently alleviated motor impairment by increasing the total traveled distances, rescued dopaminergic neurons, inhibited oxidative stress through increasing the SOD levels and decreasing MDA levels and suppressed NLRP3-mediated pyroptosis by reducing the expression levels of NLRP3, GSDMD-N, IL-1β, and caspase-1 in MPTP induced PD Mice. Moreover, in vitro experiments, the OE-NLRP3 treated group decreased cell viability, increased ROS and MDA levels, and promoted NLRP3, GSDMD-N, caspase-1, in addition to IL-1β expression levels. Furthermore, OE-NLRP3+QJG treatment significantly reversed the effect. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides pharmacological support for the use of QJG in the treatment of PD. Herein, we concluded that QJG induced the alleviation of pyroptosis by inhibiting the NLRP3/caspase-1 pathway to exert a neuroprotective effect.

A data-driven study of Alzheimer's disease related amyloid and tau pathology progression.	Amyloid-β is thought to facilitate the spread of tau throughout the neocortex in Alzheimer's disease, though how this occurs is not well understood. This is because of the spatial discordance between amyloid-β, which accumulates in the neocortex, and tau, which accumulates in the medial temporal lobe during ageing. There is evidence that in some cases amyloid-β-independent tau spreads beyond the medial temporal lobe where it may interact with neocortical amyloid-β. This suggests that there may be multiple distinct spatiotemporal subtypes of Alzheimer's-related protein aggregation, with potentially different demographic and genetic risk profiles. We investigated this hypothesis, applying data-driven disease progression subtyping models to post-mortem neuropathology and in vivo PET-based measures from two large observational studies: the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and the Religious Orders Study and Rush Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP). We consistently identified 'amyloid-first' and 'tau-first' subtypes using cross-sectional information from both studies. In the amyloid-first subtype, extensive neocortical amyloid-β precedes the spread of tau beyond the medial temporal lobe, while in the tau-first subtype, mild tau accumulates in medial temporal and neocortical areas prior to interacting with amyloid-β. As expected, we found a higher prevalence of the amyloid-first subtype among apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 allele carriers while the tau-first subtype was more common among APOE ε4 non-carriers. Within tau-first APOE ε4 carriers, we found an increased rate of amyloid-β accumulation (via longitudinal amyloid PET), suggesting that this rare group may belong within the Alzheimer's disease continuum. We also found that tau-first APOE ε4 carriers had several fewer years of education than other groups, suggesting a role for modifiable risk factors in facilitating amyloid-β-independent tau. Tau-first APOE ε4 non-carriers, in contrast, recapitulated many of the features of primary age-related tauopathy. The rate of longitudinal amyloid-β and tau accumulation (both measured via PET) within this group did not differ from normal ageing, supporting the distinction of primary age-related tauopathy from Alzheimer's disease. We also found reduced longitudinal subtype consistency within tau-first APOE ε4 non-carriers, suggesting additional heterogeneity within this group. Our findings support the idea that amyloid-β and tau may begin as independent processes in spatially disconnected regions, with widespread neocortical tau resulting from the local interaction of amyloid-β and tau. The site of this interaction may be subtype-dependent: medial temporal lobe in amyloid-first, neocortex in tau-first. These insights into the dynamics of amyloid-β and tau may inform research and clinical trials that target these pathologies.

Identifying novel mechanisms underlying dementia is critical to improving prevention and treatment. As an approach to mechanistic discovery, we investigated whether MIND diet (Mediterranean-DASH Diet Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay), a consistent risk factor for dementia, is correlated with a specific profile of cortical gene expression, and whether such a transcriptomic profile is associated with dementia, in the Religious Orders Study (ROS) and Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP). RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) was conducted in postmortem dorsolateral prefrontal cortex tissue from 1,204 deceased participants; neuropsychological assessments were performed annually prior to death. In a subset of 482 participants, diet was assessed ~6 years before death using a validated food-frequency questionnaire; in these participants, using elastic net regression, we identified a transcriptomic profile, consisting of 50 genes, significantly correlated with MIND diet score (

Loss of DJ-1 function contributes to Parkinson's disease pathogenesis in mice via RACK1-mediated PKC activation and MAO-B upregulation.	Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative motor disorder characterized by a dramatic reduction in pars compacta of substantia nigra dopaminergic neurons and striatal dopamine (DA) levels. Mutations or deletions in the PARK7/DJ-1 gene are associated with an early-onset familial form of PD. DJ-1 protein prevents neurodegeneration via its regulation of oxidative stress and mitochondrial function as well as its roles in transcription and signal transduction. In this study, we investigated how loss of DJ-1 function affected DA degradation, ROS generation and mitochondrial dysfunction in neuronal cells. We showed that loss of DJ-1 significantly increased the expression of monoamine oxidase (MAO)-B but not MAO-A in both neuronal cells and primary astrocytes. In DJ-1-knockout (KO) mice, MAO-B protein levels in the substantia nigra (SN) and striatal regions were significantly increased. We demonstrated that the induction of MAO-B expression by DJ-1 deficiency depended on early growth response 1 (EGR1) in N2a cells. By coimmunoprecipitation omics analysis, we found that DJ-1 interacted with receptor of activated protein C kinase 1 (RACK1), a scaffolding protein, and thus inhibited the activity of the PKC/JNK/AP-1/EGR1 cascade. The PKC inhibitor sotrastaurin or the JNK inhibitor SP600125 completely inhibited DJ-1 deficiency-induced EGR1 and MAO-B expression in N2a cells. Moreover, the MAO-B inhibitor rasagiline inhibited mitochondrial ROS generation and rescued neuronal cell death caused by DJ-1 deficiency, especially in response to MPTP stimulation in vitro and in vivo. These results suggest that DJ-1 exerts neuroprotective effects by inhibiting the expression of MAO-B distributed at the mitochondrial outer membrane, which mediates DA degradation, ROS generation and mitochondrial dysfunction. This study reveals a mechanistic link between DJ-1 and MAO-B expression and contributes to understanding the crosslinks among pathogenic factors, mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress in PD pathogenesis.

Locus coeruleus pathology is associated with cerebral microangiopathy at autopsy.	INTRODUCTION: We investigated the link between locus coeruleus (LC) pathology and cerebral microangiopathy in two large neuropathology datasets. METHODS: We included data from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC) database (n = 2197) and Religious Orders Study and Rush Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP; n = 1637). Generalized estimating equations and logistic regression were used to examine associations between LC hypopigmentation and presence of cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) or arteriolosclerosis, correcting for age at death, sex, cortical Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology, ante mortem cognitive status, and presence of vascular and genetic risk factors. RESULTS: LC hypopigmentation was associated with higher odds of overall CAA in the NACC dataset, leptomeningeal CAA in the ROSMAP dataset, and arteriolosclerosis in both datasets. DISCUSSION: LC pathology is associated with cerebral microangiopathy, independent of cortical AD pathology. LC degeneration could potentially contribute to the pathways relating vascular pathology to AD. Future studies of the LC-norepinephrine system on cerebrovascular health are warranted. HIGHLIGHTS: We associated locus coeruleus (LC) pathology and cerebral microangiopathy in two large autopsy datasets. LC hypopigmentation was consistently related to arteriolosclerosis in both datasets. LC hypopigmentation was related to cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) presence in the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center dataset.

Previous post-mortem assessments of TREM2 expression and its association with brain pathologies have been limited by sample size. This study sought to correlate region-specific TREM2 mRNA expression with diverse neuropathological measures at autopsy using a large sample size (N = 945) of bulk RNA sequencing data from the Religious Orders Study and Rush Memory and Aging Project (ROS/MAP). TREM2 gene expression of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, and caudate nucleus was assessed with respect to core pathology of Alzheimer's disease (amyloid-β, and tau), cerebrovascular pathology (cerebral infarcts, arteriolosclerosis, atherosclerosis, and cerebral amyloid angiopathy), microglial activation (proportion of activated microglia), and cognitive performance. We found that cortical TREM2 levels were positively related to AD diagnosis, cognitive decline, and amyloid-β neuropathology but were not related to the proportion of activated microglia. In contrast, caudate TREM2 levels were not related to AD pathology, cognition, or diagnosis, but were positively related to the proportion of activated microglia in the same region. Diagnosis-stratified results revealed caudate TREM2 levels were inversely related to AD neuropathology and positively related to microglial activation and longitudinal cognitive performance in AD cases. These results highlight the notable changes in TREM2 transcript abundance in AD and suggest that its pathological associations are brain-region-dependent.

Trends in Postmortem Neurodegenerative and Cerebrovascular Neuropathologies Over 25 Years.	IMPORTANCE: With rapid aging of the US population, understanding trends over time in dementia occurrence is essential to public health planning and intervention; this understanding includes trends in neuropathologies underlying clinical dementia. OBJECTIVE: To characterize trends in pathways underlying dementia by examining prevalence of postmortem neuropathologies in birth cohorts across 25 years. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Two longitudinal cohorts, the Religious Orders Study and the Rush Memory and Aging Project, with autopsy data from 1997 to 2022 with up to 27 years follow-up were analyzed. Deceased individuals with complete postmortem neuropathology evaluations were included, and 177 individuals with most distant (<1905) or recent (>1930) years of birth were excluded. EXPOSURES: Four categories of year of birth: 1905-1914, 1915-1919, 1920-1924, and 1925-1930. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Outcomes included pathologic diagnosis of Alzheimer disease (AD), global AD pathology, amyloid load, tau tangles, neocortical Lewy bodies, limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy neuropathological change, atherosclerosis, arteriolosclerosis, gross chronic infarcts, and chronic microinfarcts. For comparison, pathologies in each birth epoch were age-standardized to age distribution of the cohorts. χ2 Tests were used for categorical outcomes, and analysis of variance was used to compare means across birth epochs. RESULTS: Overall, 1554 participants were examined (510 [33%] male; median [range] age at death, 90 [66-108] years). Participants were distributed fairly evenly across birth epochs (1905-1914: n = 374; 1915-1919: n = 360; 1920-1924: n = 466; 1925-1930: n = 354). Across year of birth groups, no differences were found in prevalence of pathologic AD diagnosis; age-standardized prevalence fluctuated between 62% and 68% in the birth cohorts (χ2 test: P = .76 across birth epochs). Similarly, no differences were found in mean levels of global AD pathology, although there was greater density specifically of tau tangles in later birth cohorts (eg, age-standardized mean [SD], 1.53 [1.20] years for the 1905-1914 cohort and 1.87 [1.47] years for the 1925-1930 cohort; analysis of variance test: P = .01 across birth cohorts). There were no differences over time in other neurodegenerative pathologies. In contrast, atherosclerosis and arteriosclerosis were dramatically lower over time; for example, age-standardized prevalence of moderate to severe atherosclerosis ranged from 54% among those born from 1905-1914 to 22% for 1925-1930 (χ2 test: P < .001 across birth epochs). CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: In this study, few differences in neurodegenerative pathologies were found, but there may be worse levels of tau tangles across birth cohorts over 25 years. This indicates that any improvements over time in clinical dementia observed by cohorts are likely in part associated with improved resilience to pathology rather than reduced AD pathology. Finally, vessel pathologies were markedly lower over birth cohorts, indicating the assocation with brain health of populationwide improvements in several vascular risk factors.

Ginsenoside Rd protects transgenic	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a serious public health issue but few drugs are currently available for the disease, and these only target the symptoms. It is well established that oxidative stress plays a crucial role in AD, and there is compelling evidence linking oxidative stress to β-amyloid (Aβ). An exciting source of potential new AD therapeutic medication possibilities is medicinal plants. Ginsenoside Rd (GS-Rd) is one of the main bioactive substances in ginseng extracts. In our study, we used a network pharmacology analysis to identify overlapping GS-Rd (therapeutic) and AD (disease)-relevant protein targets, gene ontology (GO) and bio-process annotation, and the KEGG pathway analysis data predicted that GS-Rd impacts multiple targets and pathways, such as the MAPK signal pathway and the JAT-STAT3 signaling pathway.

AD and non-AD mediators of the pathway between the APOE genotype and cognition.	INTRODUCTION: The apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype is a driver of cognitive decline and dementia. We used causal mediation methods to characterize pathways linking the APOE genotype to late-life cognition through Alzheimer's disease (AD) and non-AD neuropathologies. METHODS: We analyzed autopsy data from 1671 individuals from the Religious Orders Study, Memory and Aging Project, and Minority Aging Research Study (ROS/MAP/MARS) studies with cognitive assessment within 5 years of death and autopsy measures of AD (amyloid beta (Aβ), neurofibrillary tangles), vascular (athero/arteriolo-sclerosis, micro-infarcts/macro-infarcts), and non-AD neurodegenerative neuropathologies (TAR DNA protein 43 [TDP-43], Lewy bodies, amyloid angiopathy, hippocampal sclerosis). RESULTS: The detrimental effect of APOE ε4 on cognition was mediated by summary measures of AD and non-AD neurodegenerative neuropathologies but not vascular neuropathologies; effects were strongest in individuals with dementia. The protective effect of APOE ε2 was partly mediated by AD neuropathology and stronger in women than in men. DISCUSSION: The APOE genotype influences cognition and dementia through multiple neuropathological pathways, with implications for different therapeutic strategies targeting people at increased risk for dementia. HIGHLIGHTS: Both apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε2 and APOE ε4 effects on late-life cognition are mediated by AD neuropathology. The estimated mediated effects of most measures of AD neuropathology were similar. Non-Alzheimer's disease (AD) neurodegenerative pathologies mediate the effect of ε4 independently from AD. Non-AD vascular pathologies did not mediate the effect of the APOE genotype on cognition. The protective effect of APOE ε2 on cognition was stronger in women.

Fragmentation of rest periods, astrocyte activation, and cognitive decline in older adults with and without Alzheimer's disease.	INTRODUCTION: Sleep disruption is associated with astrocyte activation and impaired cognition in model organisms. However, the relationship among sleep, astrocyte activation, and cognition in humans is uncertain. METHODS: We used RNA-seq to quantify the prefrontal cortex expression of a panel of human activated astrocyte marker genes in 1076 older adults in the Religious Orders Study and Rush Memory and Aging Project, 411 of whom had multi-day actigraphy prior to death. We related this to rest fragmentation, a proxy for sleep fragmentation, and to longitudinal cognitive function. RESULTS: Fragmentation of rest periods was associated with higher expression of activated astrocyte marker genes, which was associated with a lower level and faster decline of cognitive function. DISCUSSION: Astrocyte activation and fragmented rest are associated with each other and with accelerated cognitive decline. If experimental studies confirm a causal relationship, targeting sleep fragmentation and astrocyte activation may benefit cognition in older adults. HIGHLIGHTS: Greater fragmentation of rest periods, a proxy for sleep fragmentation, is associated with higher composite expression of a panel of genes characteristic of activated astrocytes. Increased expression of genes characteristic of activated astrocytes was associated with a lower level and more rapid decline of cognitive function, beyond that accounted for by the burden of amyloid and neurofibrillary tangle pathology. Longitudinal and experimental studies are needed to delineate the causal relationships among sleep, astrocyte activation, and cognition.	aging; astrocyte activation; bulk RNA-sequencing; cognitive impairment; sleep fragmentation

Longitudinal change in serial position scores in older adults with entorhinal and hippocampal neuropathologies.	OBJECTIVE: Serial position scores on verbal memory tests are sensitive to early Alzheimer's disease (AD)-related neuropathological changes that occur in the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus.

METHODS: This study uses longitudinal data from the Religious Orders Study and the Rush Memory and Aging Project. Participants ( RESULTS: Primacy scores declined ( CONCLUSIONS: In older adults with hippocampal neuropathologies, primacy score decline may be a sensitive marker of early AD-related changes.

Current fluid biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease (AD) track amyloid-β (Aβ) pathology more strongly than tau, even though clinical and cognitive decline relate more closely to tau. We evaluated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) phosphorylated tau at epitope 205 (p-tau205), measured using immunoassays, as a biomarker of tau aggregation. A total of 2,069 samples from the BioFINDER-2 (n=1,364) and BioFINDER-1 (n=705) cohorts spanning the full AD continuum were analyzed to assess cross-sectional and longitudinal associations with imaging and clinical measures. CSF p-tau205 levels were elevated in both biologically and clinically advanced disease stages. In Aβ-positive individuals, cross-sectional p-tau205 correlated with Aβ-PET (R²=0.26), tau-PET (R²=0.29), cortical atrophy (R²=0.14) and cognition (MMSE, R²=0.14). Baseline p-tau205 predicted subsequent Aβ accumulation (R²=0.44) and tau-PET uptake (R²=0.33), and increased more steeply over time in Aβ-positive than Aβ-negative participants (β[95%CI]=0.16[0.12-0.21], p<0.001). Longitudinal p-tau205 change related to cortical thinning (R²=0.32) and cognitive decline (R²≥0.41). Incorporating Aβ42/40, p-tau217 and p-tau205 into a CSF-based staging model, the final p-tau205-positive stage showed the strongest cortical atrophy, cognitive impairment, and risk of incident dementia (HR=6.40[4.28-9.59]). These findings support CSF p-tau205 as a valuable marker for biological staging and progression monitoring in AD.

Reference proteins to improve Core 1 and Core 2 Alzheimer's disease CSF and plasma biomarkers.	Concentration-based fluid biomarkers represent an informative and cost-effective way to detect and monitor Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. However, non-AD-related inter-individual variation in biofluids can also affect biomarker concentrations. Here, we investigated whether normalization of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma biomarkers to reference proteins, such as amyloid-β40 (Aβ40) and non-phosphorylated mid-region tau (np-tau), improves their robustness and reliability of representing AD pathology load. Using the Swedish BioFINDER-2 cohort (n=1702, 50.7% male, mean [SD] age 68.4 [12.2] years), we compared the associations between tau/Aβ-PET load and fluid biomarkers alone versus in a ratio with a reference protein (Aβ40 or np-tau) in univariate linear regression models. Fluid biomarkers included CSF and plasma measures of p-tau217, p-tau181, p-tau205, np-tau181-190, np-tau195-210, np-tau212-221, Aβ42, Aβ40, and CSF MTBR-tau243, SNAP-25, neurogranin, YKL-40, sTREM2, and plasma eMTBR-tau243. Biomarkers were measured with mass spectrometry assays and/or immunoassays. In addition, we performed validation and extended analyses, comparing for example group-level diagnostic differences and longitudinal biomarker trajectories, in three independent prospective cohorts: BioFINDER-1, Knight Alzheimer Disease Research Center (ADRC), and Translational Biomarkers in Aging and Dementia (TRIAD), as well as in an Italian multiple sclerosis cohort. CSF Aβ40 normalization significantly strengthened the associations of several core CSF AD biomarkers, including CSF MTBR-tau243, p-tau isoforms and synaptic biomarkers, with tau-PET (ΔR²=0.064-0.24) and Aβ-PET (ΔR² = 0.016-0.28). Normalization to CSF np-tau mainly improved concordance with Aβ-PET (ΔR² = -0.0059-0.19). The strongest association with tau-PET was observed for MTBR-tau243/Aβ40 (R² = 0.78, compared to 0.65 for non-normalized MTBR-tau243), and with Aβ-PET for p-tau217/np-tau (R² = 0.65, compared to 0.46 for non-normalized p-tau217). Plasma biomarker associations with tau-PET improved when using normalization to plasma Aβ40 or np-tau (ΔR² = 0.004-0.14), with the strongest effect for eMTBR-tau243/np-tau (R² = 0.72 versus 0.60). Associations with Aβ-PET were enhanced with np-tau normalization (ΔR² = 0.018-0.16, strongest for p-tau217/np-tau: R² = 0.62 versus 0.53). The results were replicated in Knight ADRC and TRIAD. Furthermore, longitudinal analyses showed that Aβ40 normalization typically reduced inter-individual rather than intra-individual variability over time. Normalization did not enhance group-level differences in inflammatory CSF biomarkers in AD, nor did it improve biomarker associations in the multiple sclerosis cohort. In conclusion, normalization of CSF and plasma biomarkers to reference proteins, such as Aβ40 or np-tau, enhances their association with brain tau and Aβ pathology, making already high-performing AD fluid biomarkers even more accurate.

Quantitation of PET spatial extent as a potential adjunct to visual interpretation of [	"PURPOSE: Among visually Tau-PET-positive scans, large variation exists in the size of the visually tau-positive area. Here, we propose a metric quantifying the spatial extent of visual Tau-PET-positivity, termed ""TAU-SPEX"", and evaluate associations with visual read status, neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) pathology at autopsy, and cognition. METHODS: [ RESULTS: TAU-SPEX demonstrated strong performance in distinguishing tau-negative from tau-positive participants (AUC: 0.97). Moreover, TAU-SPEX showed high accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value (all > 0.90) for identifying tau-positive participants, and showed high sensitivity (87.5%) and specificity (100.0%) for identifying participants with NFT Braak-V/VI pathology.

IMPORTANCE: Alzheimer disease (AD) predominates in females at almost twice the rate relative to males. Mounting evidence in adults without AD indicates that females exhibit higher tau deposition than age-matched males, particularly in the setting of elevated β-amyloid (Aβ), but the evidence for sex differences in tau accumulation rates is inconclusive. OBJECTIVE: To examine whether female sex is associated with faster tau accumulation in the setting of high Aβ (as measured with positron emission tomography [PET]) and the moderating influence of sex on the association between APOEε4 carrier status and tau accumulation. DATA SOURCES: This meta-analysis used data from 6 longitudinal aging and AD studies, including the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, Berkeley Aging Cohort Study, BioFINDER 1, Harvard Aging Brain Study, Mayo Clinic Study of Aging, and Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer Prevention. Longitudinal data were collected between November 2004 and May 2022. STUDY SELECTION: Included studies required available longitudinal [18F]flortaucipir or [18F]-MK-6240 tau-PET scans, as well as baseline [11C] Pittsburgh Compound B, [18F]flutemetamol or [18F]florbetapir Aβ-PET scans. Recruitment criteria varied across studies. Analyses began on August 7, 2023, and were completed on February 5, 2024. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: In each study, primary analyses extracted estimates for the sex (female or male) and the sex by baseline Aβ-PET status (high or low) association with longitudinal tau-PET using a series of mixed-effects models. Secondary mixed-effects models extracted the interaction estimate for the association of sex by APOEε4 carrier status with longitudinal tau-PET. Study-specific estimates for each mixed-effects model were then pooled in a meta-analysis, and the global fixed effect (β) and total heterogeneity (I2) across studies were estimated. This study is reported following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) reporting guideline. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Seven tau-PET outcomes that showed cross-sectional sex differences were examined across temporal, parietal, and occipital lobes. RESULTS: Among 6 studies assessed, there were 1376 participants (761 [55%] female; mean [range] age at first tau scan, 71.9 [46-93] years; 401 participants [29%] with high baseline Aβ; 412 APOEε4 carriers [30%]). Among individuals with high baseline Aβ, female sex was associated with faster tau accumulation localized to inferior temporal (β = -0.14; 95% CI, -0.22 to -0.06; P = .009) temporal fusiform (β = -0.13; 95% CI, -0.23 to -0.04; P = .02), and lateral occipital regions (β = -0.15; 95% CI, -0.24 to -0.06; P = .009) compared with male sex. Among APOEε4 carriers, female sex was associated with faster inferior-temporal tau accumulation (β = -0.10; 95% CI, -0.16 to -0.03; P = .01). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These findings suggest that sex differences in the pathological progression of AD call for sex-specific timing considerations when administrating anti-Aβ and anti-tau treatments.

APOE4 impact on soluble and insoluble tau pathology is mostly influenced by amyloid-β.	The APOE4 allele is the strongest genetic risk factor for sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although APOE4 is strongly associated with amyloid-β (Aβ), its relationship with tau accumulation is less understood. Studies evaluating the role of APOE4 on tau accumulation showed conflicting results, particularly regarding the independence of these associations from Aβ load. In this study, we examined three independent longitudinal cohorts (BioFINDER-1, BioFINDER-2 and WRAP), in which participants had cross-sectional and longitudinal measures of tau tangles [tau-PET; temporal meta-region of interest (meta-ROI) and entorhinal] or soluble p-tau (p-tau217), Aβ-PET and APOE genotype. The study included a total of 1370 cognitively unimpaired subjects and 449 with mild cognitive impairment, followed longitudinally with tau-PET and p-tau217. APOE4 carriers accounted for 40.2%-50% of the cohorts. Different linear regressions (cross-sectional) and linear mixed-effect models (longitudinal) with tau measures as outcomes were fitted to test the effect of APOE4 both as an independent predictor and in combination with baseline Aβ load (including interaction). All models included age, sex and cognitive status as covariates. We found no independent effects of APOE4 carriership on insoluble tau in either cohort (BioFINDER-2 or WRAP), on both cross-sectional and longitudinal tau-PET in the temporal meta-ROI, when Aβ was present in the model (P = 0.531-0.949). Aβ alone was the best predictor of insoluble tau accumulation, with no interaction between APOE4 and Aβ on tau-PET. In BioFINDER-2, there was a significant interaction between APOE4 and Aβ (b = 0.166, P < 0.001) in the entorhinal cortex at baseline. However, the interaction was not present in WRAP PET. No independent effects of the APOE4 carriership on baseline (P = 0.683-0.708) and longitudinal (P = 0.188-0.570) soluble p-tau217 were observed when Aβ was included in the model in BioFINDER-1 and WRAP. Likewise, no interaction between APOE4 and Aβ on soluble p-tau217 was observed. Mediation analysis revealed that Aβ load fully mediated most associations between APOE4 and tau (46%-112%, either cross-sectional or longitudinal tau-PET or soluble p-tau217). In the largest cohort (BioFINDER-2), looking at APOE4 groups by the number of ε4 alleles, we found an interaction between APOE4 homozygotes and Aβ on tau-PET levels at baseline and over time in the temporal meta-ROI, whereas in the entorhinal cortex this effect was observed only at baseline. In conclusion, although APOE4 is strongly associated with Aβ aggregation, it seems to be associated minimally with longitudinal changes in soluble or insoluble p-tau levels at a given level of Aβ pathology, confirming the primacy of Aβ in driving tau pathology.

Plasma Phosphorylated Tau 217 and Aβ42/40 to Predict Early Brain Aβ Accumulation in People Without Cognitive Impairment.	IMPORTANCE: Phase 3 trials of successful antiamyloid therapies in Alzheimer disease (AD) have demonstrated improved clinical efficacy in people with less severe disease. Plasma biomarkers will be essential for efficient screening of participants in future primary prevention clinical trials testing antiamyloid therapies in cognitively unimpaired (CU) individuals with initially low brain β-amyloid (Aβ) levels who are at high risk of accumulating Aβ. OBJECTIVE: To investigate if combining plasma biomarkers could be useful in predicting subsequent development of Aβ pathology in CU individuals with subthreshold brain Aβ levels (defined as Aβ levels <40 Centiloids) at baseline. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This was a longitudinal study including Swedish BioFINDER-2 (enrollment 2017-2022) and replication in 2 independent cohorts, the Knight Alzheimer Disease Research Center (Knight ADRC; enrollment 1988 and 2019) and Swedish BioFINDER-1 (enrollment 2009-2015). Included for analysis was a convenience sample of CU individuals with baseline plasma phosphorylated tau 217 (p-tau217) and Aβ42/40 assessments and Aβ assessments with positron emission tomography (Aβ-PET) or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Aβ42/40. Data were analyzed between April 2023 and May 2024. EXPOSURES: Baseline plasma levels of Aβ42/40, p-tau217, the ratio of p-tau217 to nonphosphorylated tau (%p-tau217), p-tau231, and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Cross-sectional and longitudinal PET and CSF measures of brain Aβ pathology. RESULTS: This study included 495 (BioFINDER-2), 283 (Knight ADRC), and 205 (BioFINDER-1) CU participants. In BioFINDER-2, the mean (SD) age was 65.7 (14.4) with 261 females (52.7%). When detecting abnormal CSF Aβ-status, a combination of plasma %p-tau217 and Aβ42/40 showed better performance (area under the curve = 0.949; 95% CI, 0.929-0.970; P <.02) than individual biomarkers. In CU participants with subthreshold baseline Aβ-PET, baseline plasma %p-tau217 and Aβ42/40 levels were significantly associated with baseline Aβ-PET (n = 384) and increases in Aβ-PET over time (n = 224). Associations of plasma %p-tau217 and Aβ42/40 and their interaction with baseline Aβ-PET (%p-tau217: β = 2.77; 95% CI, 1.84-3.70; Aβ42/40: β = -1.64; 95% CI, -2.53 to -0.75; %p-tau217 × Aβ42/40: β = -2.14; 95% CI, -2.79 to -1.49; P < .001) and longitudinal Aβ-PET (%p-tau217: β = 0.67; 95% CI, 0.48-0.87; Aβ42/40: β = -0.33; 95% CI, -0.51 to -0.15; %p-tau217 × Aβ42/40: β = -0.31; 95% CI, -0.44 to -0.18; P < .001) were also significant in the models combining the 2 baseline biomarkers as predictors. Similarly, baseline plasma p-tau217 and Aβ42/40 were independently associated with longitudinal Aβ-PET in Knight ADRC (%p-tau217: β = 0.71; 95% CI, 0.26-1.16; P = .002; Aβ42/40: β = -0.74; 95% CI, -1.26 to -0.22; P = .006) and longitudinal CSF Aβ42/40 in BioFINDER-1 (p-tau217: β = -0.0003; 95% CI, -0.0004 to -0.0001; P = .01; Aβ42/40: β = 0.0004; 95% CI, 0.0002-0.0006; P < .001) in CU participants with subthreshold Aβ levels at baseline. Plasma p-tau231 and GFAP did not provide any clear independent value. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Results of this cohort study suggest that combining plasma p-tau217and Aβ42/40 levels could be useful for predicting development of Aβ pathology in people with early stages of subthreshold Aβ accumulation. These biomarkers might thus facilitate screening of participants for future primary prevention trials.

MRI Signature of α-Synuclein Pathology in Asymptomatic Stages and a Memory Clinic Population.	IMPORTANCE: The lack of an in vivo measure for α-synuclein (α-syn) pathology until recently has limited thorough characterization of its brain atrophy pattern, especially during early disease stages. OBJECTIVE: To assess the association of state-of-the-art cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) seed amplification assays (SAA) α-syn positivity (SAA α-syn+) with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) structural measures, across the continuum from clinically unimpaired (CU) to cognitively impaired (CI) individuals, in 3 independent cohorts, and separately in CU and CI individuals, the latter reflecting a memory clinic population. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Cross-sectional data were used from the Swedish BioFINDER-2 study (inclusion, 2017-2023) as the discovery cohort and the Swedish BioFINDER-1 study (inclusion, 2007-2015) and Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI; inclusion 2005-2022) as replication cohorts. All cohorts are from multicenter studies, but the BioFINDER cohorts used 1 MRI scanner. CU and CI individuals fulfilling inclusion criteria and without missing data points in relevant metrics were included in the study. All analyses were performed from 2023 to 2024. EXPOSURES: Presence of α-syn pathology, estimated by baseline CSF SAA α-syn. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcomes were cross-sectional structural MRI measures either through voxel-based morphometry (VBM) or regions of interest (ROI) including an automated pipeline for cholinergic basal forebrain nuclei CH4/4p (nucleus basalis of Meynert [NBM]) and CH1/2/3. Secondary outcomes were domain-specific cross-sectional cognitive measures. Analyses were adjusted for CSF biomarkers of Alzheimer pathology. RESULTS: A total of 2961 participants were included in this study: 1388 (mean [SD] age, 71 [10] years; 702 female [51%]) from the BioFINDER-2 study, 752 (mean [SD] age, 72 [6] years; 406 female [54%]) from the BioFINDER-1 study, and 821 (mean [SD] age, 75 [8] years; 449 male [55%]) from ADNI. In the BioFINDER-2 study, VBM analyses in the whole cohort revealed a specific association between SAA α-syn+ and the cholinergic NBM, even when adjusting for Alzheimer copathology. ROI-based analyses in the BioFINDER-2 study focused on regions involved in the cholinergic system and confirmed that SAA α-syn+ was indeed independently associated with smaller NBM (β = -0.271; 95% CI, -0.399 to -0.142; P <.001) and CH1/2/3 volumes (β = -0.227; 95% CI, -0.377 to -0.076; P =.02). SAA α-syn+ was also independently associated with smaller NBM volumes in the separate CU (β = -0.360; 95% CI, -0.603 to -0.117; P =.03) and CI (β = -0.251; 95% CI, -0.408 to -0.095; P =.02) groups. Overall, the association between SAA α-syn+ and NBM volume was replicated in the BioFINDER-1 study and ADNI cohort. In CI individuals, NBM volumes partially mediated the association of SAA α-syn+ with attention/executive impairments in all cohorts (BioFINDER-2, β = -0.017; proportion-mediated effect, 7%; P =.04; BioFINDER-1, β = -0.096; proportion-mediated effect, 19%; P =.04; ADNI, β = -0.061; proportion-mediated effect, 20%; P =.007). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study, SAA α-syn+ was consistently associated with NBM atrophy already during asymptomatic stages. Further, in memory clinic CI populations, SAA α-syn+ was associated with NBM atrophy, which partially mediated α-syn-induced attention/executive impairment.

Predicting progression from subjective cognitive decline to mild cognitive impairment or dementia based on brain atrophy patterns.	"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder where pathophysiological changes begin decades before the onset of clinical symptoms. Analysis of brain atrophy patterns using structural MRI and multivariate data analysis are an effective tool in identifying patients with subjective cognitive decline (SCD) at higher risk of progression to AD dementia. Atrophy patterns obtained from models trained to classify advanced AD versus normal subjects, may not be optimal for subjects at an early stage, like SCD. In this study, we compared the accuracy of the SCD progression prediction using the 'severity index' generated using a standard classification model trained on patients with AD dementia versus a new model trained on β-amyloid (Aβ) positive patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI). METHODS: We used structural MRI data of 504 patients from the Swedish BioFINDER-1 study cohort (cognitively normal (CN), Aβ-negative = 220; SCD, Aβ positive and negative = 139; aMCI, Aβ-positive = 106; AD dementia = 39). We applied multivariate data analysis to create two predictive models trained to discriminate CN individuals from either individuals with Aβ positive aMCI or AD dementia. Models were applied to individuals with SCD to classify their atrophy patterns as either high-risk ""disease-like"" or low-risk ""CN-like"". Clinical trajectory and model accuracy were evaluated using 8 years of longitudinal data. RESULTS: In predicting progression from SCD to MCI or dementia, the standard, dementia-based model, reached 100% specificity but only 10.6% sensitivity, while the new, aMCI-based model, reached 72.3% sensitivity and 60.9% specificity. The aMCI-based model was superior in predicting progression from SCD to MCI or dementia, reaching a higher receiver operating characteristic area under curve (AUC = 0.72; P = 0.037) in comparison with the dementia-based model (AUC = 0.57). CONCLUSION: When predicting conversion from SCD to MCI or dementia using structural MRI data, prediction models based on individuals with milder levels of atrophy (i.e. aMCI) may offer superior clinical value compared to standard dementia-based models."

Comparing a pre-defined versus deep learning approach for extracting brain atrophy patterns to predict cognitive decline due to Alzheimer's disease in patients with mild cognitive symptoms.	BACKGROUND: Predicting future Alzheimer's disease (AD)-related cognitive decline among individuals with subjective cognitive decline (SCD) or mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is an important task for healthcare. Structural brain imaging as measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) could potentially contribute when making such predictions. It is unclear if the predictive performance of MRI can be improved using entire brain images in deep learning (DL) models compared to using pre-defined brain regions. METHODS: A cohort of 332 individuals with SCD/MCI were included from the Swedish BioFINDER-1 study. The goal was to predict longitudinal SCD/MCI-to-AD dementia progression and change in Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) over four years. Four models were evaluated using different predictors: (1) clinical data only, including demographics, cognitive tests and APOE ε4 status, (2) clinical data plus hippocampal volume, (3) clinical data plus all regional MRI gray matter volumes (N = 68) extracted using FreeSurfer software, (4) a DL model trained using multi-task learning with MRI images, Jacobian determinant images and baseline cognition as input. A double cross-validation scheme, with five test folds and for each of those ten validation folds, was used. External evaluation was performed on part of the ADNI dataset, including 108 patients. Mann-Whitney U-test was used to determine statistically significant differences in performance, with p-values less than 0.05 considered significant. RESULTS: In the BioFINDER cohort, 109 patients (33%) progressed to AD dementia. The performance of the clinical data model for prediction of progression to AD dementia was area under the curve (AUC) = 0.85 and four-year cognitive decline was R CONCLUSIONS: The DL model did not significantly improve the prediction of clinical disease progression in AD, compared to regression models with a single pre-defined brain region.

Plasma N-terminal containing tau fragments (NTA-tau): a biomarker of tau deposition in Alzheimer's Disease.	BACKGROUND: Novel phosphorylated-tau (p-tau) blood biomarkers (e.g., p-tau181, p-tau217 or p-tau231), are highly specific for Alzheimer's disease (AD), and can track amyloid-β (Aβ) and tau pathology. However, because these biomarkers are strongly associated with the emergence of Aβ pathology, it is difficult to determine the contribution of insoluble tau aggregates to the plasma p-tau signal in blood. Therefore, there remains a need for a biomarker capable of specifically tracking insoluble tau accumulation in brain. METHODS: NTA is a novel ultrasensitive assay targeting N-terminal containing tau fragments (NTA-tau) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma, which is elevated in AD. Using two well-characterized research cohorts (BioFINDER-2, n = 1,294, and BioFINDER-1, n = 932), we investigated the association between plasma NTA-tau levels and disease progression in AD, including tau accumulation, brain atrophy and cognitive decline. RESULTS: We demonstrate that plasma NTA-tau increases across the AD continuum¸ especially during late stages, and displays a moderate-to-strong association with tau-PET (β = 0.54, p < 0.001) in Aβ-positive participants, while weak with Aβ-PET (β = 0.28, p < 0.001). Unlike plasma p-tau181, GFAP, NfL and t-tau, tau pathology determined with tau-PET is the most prominent contributor to NTA-tau variance (52.5% of total R CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that plasma NTA-tau levels increase across the AD continuum, especially during mid-to-late AD stages, and it is closely associated with in vivo tau tangle deposition in AD and its downstream effects. Moreover, this novel biomarker has potential as a cost-effective and easily accessible tool for monitoring disease progression and cognitive decline in clinical settings, and as an outcome measure in clinical trials which also need to assess the downstream effects of successful Aβ removal.

Combined Connectomics, MAPT Gene Expression, and Amyloid Deposition to Explain Regional Tau Deposition in Alzheimer Disease.	OBJECTIVE: We aimed to test whether region-specific factors, including spatial expression patterns of the tau-encoding gene MAPT and regional levels of amyloid positron emission tomography (PET), enhance connectivity-based modeling of the spatial variability in tau-PET deposition in the Alzheimer disease (AD) spectrum. METHODS: We included 685 participants (395 amyloid-positive participants within AD spectrum and 290 amyloid-negative controls) with tau-PET and amyloid-PET from 3 studies (Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, RESULTS: Connectivity alone explained 21.8 to 39.2% (range across 3 studies) of the variance in tau-PET ROI values averaged across amyloid-positive participants. Stepwise addition of MAPT gene expression and amyloid-PET increased the proportion of explained variance to 30.2 to 46.0% and 45.0 to 49.9%, respectively. Similarly, for the prediction of patient-level tau-PET ROI values, combining all 3 predictors significantly improved the variability explained (mean adjusted R INTERPRETATION: Across 3 study samples, combining the functional connectome and molecular properties substantially enhanced the explanatory power compared to single modalities, providing a valuable tool to explain regional susceptibility to tau deposition in AD.

A two-step workflow based on plasma p-tau217 to screen for amyloid β positivity with further confirmatory testing only in uncertain cases.	Cost-effective strategies for identifying amyloid-β (Aβ) positivity in patients with cognitive impairment are urgently needed with recent approvals of anti-Aβ immunotherapies for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Blood biomarkers can accurately detect AD pathology, but it is unclear whether their incorporation into a full diagnostic workflow can reduce the number of confirmatory cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or positron emission tomography (PET) tests needed while accurately classifying patients. We evaluated a two-step workflow for determining Aβ-PET status in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) from two independent memory clinic-based cohorts (n = 348). A blood-based model including plasma tau protein 217 (p-tau217), age and APOE ε4 status was developed in BioFINDER-1 (area under the curve (AUC) = 89.3%) and validated in BioFINDER-2 (AUC = 94.3%). In step 1, the blood-based model was used to stratify the patients into low, intermediate or high risk of Aβ-PET positivity. In step 2, we assumed referral only of intermediate-risk patients to CSF Aβ42/Aβ40 testing, whereas step 1 alone determined Aβ-status for low- and high-risk groups. Depending on whether lenient, moderate or stringent thresholds were used in step 1, the two-step workflow overall accuracy for detecting Aβ-PET status was 88.2%, 90.5% and 92.0%, respectively, while reducing the number of necessary CSF tests by 85.9%, 72.7% and 61.2%, respectively. In secondary analyses, an adapted version of the BioFINDER-1 model led to successful validation of the two-step workflow with a different plasma p-tau217 immunoassay in patients with cognitive impairment from the TRIAD cohort (n = 84). In conclusion, using a plasma p-tau217-based model for risk stratification of patients with MCI can substantially reduce the need for confirmatory testing while accurately classifying patients, offering a cost-effective strategy to detect AD in memory clinic settings.

Comparison of Group-Level and Individualized Brain Regions for Measuring Change in Longitudinal Tau Positron Emission Tomography in Alzheimer Disease.	IMPORTANCE: Longitudinal tau positron emission tomography (PET) is a relevant outcome in clinical trials evaluating disease-modifying therapies in Alzheimer disease (AD). A key unanswered question is whether the use of participant-specific (individualized) regions of interest (ROIs) is superior to conventional approaches where the same ROI (group-level) is used for each participant. OBJECTIVE: To compare group- and participant-level ROIs in participants at different stages of the AD clinical continuum in terms of annual percentage change in tau-PET standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) and sample size requirements. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This was a longitudinal cohort study with consecutive participant enrollment between September 18, 2017, and November 15, 2021. Included in the analysis were participants with mild cognitive impairment and AD dementia from the prospective and longitudinal Swedish Biomarkers For Identifying Neurodegenerative Disorders Early and Reliably 2 (BioFINDER-2) study; in addition, a validation sample (the AVID 05e, Expedition-3, Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative [ADNI], and BioFINDER-1 study cohorts) was also included. EXPOSURES: Tau PET (BioFINDER-2, [18F]RO948; validation sample, [18F]flortaucipir), 7 group-level (5 data-driven stages, meta-temporal, whole brain), and 5 individualized ROIs. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Annual percentage change in tau-PET SUVR across ROIs. Sample size requirements in simulated clinical trials using tau PET as an outcome were also calculated. RESULTS: A total of 215 participants (mean [SD] age, 71.4 (7.5) years; 111 male [51.6%]) from the BioFINDER-2 study were included in this analysis: 97 amyloid-β (Aβ)-positive cognitively unimpaired (CU) individuals, 77 with Aβ-positive mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 41 with AD dementia. In the validation sample were 137 Aβ-positive CU participants, 144 with Aβ-positive MCI, and 125 with AD dementia. Mean (SD) follow-up time was 1.8 (0.3) years. Using group-level ROIs, the largest annual percentage increase in tau-PET SUVR in Aβ-positive CU individuals was seen in a composite ROI combining the entorhinal cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala (4.29%; 95% CI, 3.42%-5.16%). In individuals with Aβ-positive MCI, the greatest change was seen in the temporal cortical regions (5.82%; 95% CI, 4.67%-6.97%), whereas in those with AD dementia, the greatest change was seen in the parietal regions (5.22%; 95% CI, 3.95%-6.49%). Significantly higher estimates of annual percentage change were found using several of the participant-specific ROIs. Importantly, the simplest participant-specific approach, where change in tau PET was calculated in an ROI that best matched the participant's data-driven disease stage, performed best in all 3 subgroups. For the power analysis, sample size reductions for the participant-specific ROIs ranged from 15.94% (95% CI, 8.14%-23.74%) to 72.10% (95% CI, 67.10%-77.20%) compared with the best-performing group-level ROIs. Findings were replicated using [18F]flortaucipir. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Finding suggest that certain individualized ROIs carry an advantage over group-level ROIs for assessing longitudinal tau changes and increase the power to detect treatment effects in AD clinical trials using longitudinal tau PET as an outcome.

Plasma amyloid-β42/40 and apolipoprotein E for amyloid PET pre-screening in secondary prevention trials of Alzheimer's disease.	The extent to which newly developed blood-based biomarkers could reduce screening costs in secondary prevention trials of Alzheimer's disease is mostly unexplored. We collected plasma amyloid-β42/40, apolipoprotein E ε4 status and amyloid PET at baseline in 181 cognitively unimpaired participants [the age of 72.9 (5.3) years; 61.9% female; education of 11.9 (3.4) years] from the Swedish BioFINDER-1 study. We tested whether a model predicting amyloid PET status from plasma amyloid-β42/40, apolipoprotein E status and age (combined) reduced cost of recruiting amyloid PET + cognitively unimpaired participants into a theoretical trial. We found that the percentage of cognitively unimpaired participants with an amyloid PET + scan rose from 29% in an unscreened population to 64% [(49, 79);	Alzheimer’s disease; PET; amyloid; clinical trials; plasma biomarkers

Prediction of Longitudinal Cognitive Decline in Preclinical Alzheimer Disease Using Plasma Biomarkers.	IMPORTANCE: Alzheimer disease (AD) pathology starts with a prolonged phase of β-amyloid (Aβ) accumulation without symptoms. The duration of this phase differs greatly among individuals. While this disease phase has high relevance for clinical trial designs, it is currently unclear how to best predict the onset of clinical progression. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate combinations of different plasma biomarkers for predicting cognitive decline in Aβ-positive cognitively unimpaired (CU) individuals. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This prospective population-based prognostic study evaluated data from 2 prospective longitudinal cohort studies (the Swedish BioFINDER-1 and the Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer Prevention [WRAP]), with data collected from February 8, 2010, to October 21, 2020, for the BioFINDER-1 cohort and from August 11, 2011, to June 27, 2021, for the WRAP cohort. Participants were CU individuals recruited from memory clinics who had brain Aβ pathology defined by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Aβ42/40 in the BioFINDER-1 study and by Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB) positron emission tomography (PET) in the WRAP study. A total of 564 eligible Aβ-positive and Aβ-negative CU participants with available relevant data from the BioFINDER-1 and WRAP cohorts were included in the study; of those, 171 Aβ-positive participants were included in the main analyses. EXPOSURES: Baseline P-tau181, P-tau217, P-tau231, glial fibrillary filament protein, and neurofilament light measured in plasma; CSF biomarkers in the BioFINDER-1 cohort, and PiB PET uptake in the WRAP cohort. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was longitudinal measures of cognition (using the Mini-Mental State Examination [MMSE] and the modified Preclinical Alzheimer Cognitive Composite [mPACC]) over a median of 6 years (range, 2-10 years). The secondary outcome was conversion to AD dementia. Baseline biomarkers were used in linear regression models to predict rates of longitudinal cognitive change (calculated separately). Models were adjusted for age, sex, years of education, apolipoprotein E ε4 allele status, and baseline cognition. Multivariable models were compared based on model R2 coefficients and corrected Akaike information criterion. RESULTS: Among 171 Aβ-positive CU participants included in the main analyses, 119 (mean [SD] age, 73.0 [5.4] years; 60.5% female) were from the BioFINDER-1 study, and 52 (mean [SD] age, 64.4 [4.6] years; 65.4% female) were from the WRAP study. In the BioFINDER-1 cohort, plasma P-tau217 was the best marker to predict cognitive decline in the mPACC (model R2 = 0.41) and the MMSE (model R2 = 0.34) and was superior to the covariates-only models (mPACC: R2 = 0.23; MMSE: R2 = 0.04; P < .001 for both comparisons). Results were validated in the WRAP cohort; for example, plasma P-tau217 was associated with mPACC slopes (R2 = 0.13 vs 0.01 in the covariates-only model; P = .01) and MMSE slopes (R2 = 0.29 vs 0.24 in the covariates-only model; P = .046). Sparse models were identified with plasma P-tau217 as a predictor of cognitive decline. Power calculations for enrichment in hypothetical clinical trials revealed large relative reductions in sample sizes when using plasma P-tau217 to enrich for CU individuals likely to experience cognitive decline over time. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this study, plasma P-tau217 predicted cognitive decline in patients with preclinical AD. These findings suggest that plasma P-tau217 may be used as a complement to CSF or PET for participant selection in clinical trials of novel disease-modifying treatments.

Discriminative accuracy of the A/T/N scheme to identify cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's disease.	INTRODUCTION: The optimal combination of amyloid-β/tau/neurodegeneration (A/T/N) biomarker profiles for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia is unclear. METHODS: We examined the discriminative accuracy of A/T/N combinations assessed with neuroimaging biomarkers for the differentiation of AD from cognitively unimpaired (CU) elderly and non-AD neurodegenerative diseases in the TRIAD, BioFINDER-1 and BioFINDER-2 cohorts (total RESULTS: For the diagnosis of AD dementia (vs. CU elderly), T biomarkers performed as well as the complete A/T/N system (AUC range: 0.90-0.99). A and T biomarkers in isolation performed as well as the complete A/T/N system in differentiating AD dementia from non-AD neurodegenerative diseases (AUC range; A biomarker: 0.84-1; T biomarker: 0.83-1). DISCUSSION: In diagnostic settings, the use of A or T neuroimaging biomarkers alone can reduce patient burden and medical costs compared with using their combination, without significantly compromising accuracy.

Confounding factors of Alzheimer's disease plasma biomarkers and their impact on clinical performance.	INTRODUCTION: Plasma biomarkers will likely revolutionize the diagnostic work-up of Alzheimer's disease (AD) globally. Before widespread use, we need to determine if confounding factors affect the levels of these biomarkers, and their clinical utility. METHODS: Participants with plasma and CSF biomarkers, creatinine, body mass index (BMI), and medical history data were included (BioFINDER-1: n = 748, BioFINDER-2: n = 421). We measured beta-amyloid (Aβ42, Aβ40), phosphorylated tau (p-tau217, p-tau181), neurofilament light (NfL), and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). RESULTS: In both cohorts, creatinine and BMI were the main factors associated with NfL, GFAP, and to a lesser extent with p-tau. However, adjustment for BMI and creatinine had only minor effects in models predicting either the corresponding levels in CSF or subsequent development of dementia. DISCUSSION: Creatinine and BMI are related to certain plasma biomarkers levels, but they do not have clinically relevant confounding effects for the vast majority of individuals. HIGHLIGHTS: Creatinine and body mass index (BMI) are related to certain plasma biomarker levels. Adjusting for creatinine and BMI has minor influence on plasma-cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) associations. Adjusting for creatinine and BMI has minor influence on prediction of dementia using plasma biomarkers.	amyloid; cerebrospinal fluid; dementia; glial fibrillary acidic protein; neurofilament light; p-tau

Current fluid biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease (AD) track amyloid-β (Aβ) pathology more strongly than tau, even though clinical and cognitive decline relate more closely to tau. We evaluated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) phosphorylated tau at epitope 205 (p-tau205), measured using immunoassays, as a biomarker of tau aggregation. A total of 2,069 samples from the BioFINDER-2 (n=1,364) and BioFINDER-1 (n=705) cohorts spanning the full AD continuum were analyzed to assess cross-sectional and longitudinal associations with imaging and clinical measures. CSF p-tau205 levels were elevated in both biologically and clinically advanced disease stages. In Aβ-positive individuals, cross-sectional p-tau205 correlated with Aβ-PET (R²=0.26), tau-PET (R²=0.29), cortical atrophy (R²=0.14) and cognition (MMSE, R²=0.14). Baseline p-tau205 predicted subsequent Aβ accumulation (R²=0.44) and tau-PET uptake (R²=0.33), and increased more steeply over time in Aβ-positive than Aβ-negative participants (β[95%CI]=0.16[0.12-0.21], p<0.001). Longitudinal p-tau205 change related to cortical thinning (R²=0.32) and cognitive decline (R²≥0.41). Incorporating Aβ42/40, p-tau217 and p-tau205 into a CSF-based staging model, the final p-tau205-positive stage showed the strongest cortical atrophy, cognitive impairment, and risk of incident dementia (HR=6.40[4.28-9.59]). These findings support CSF p-tau205 as a valuable marker for biological staging and progression monitoring in AD.

Biological classification of memory clinic patients.	Neurodegenerative diseases have traditionally been defined in vivo based on clinical symptoms. However, the development of biomarkers has enabled a shift toward in vivo biological definitions. There is now a need to characterize memory clinic populations using multi-dimensional biomarker information. Here, we employed a data-driven approach to develop a biological framework for categorizing individuals in a heterogenous memory clinic cohort based on the presence, extent, and sequence of several common pathologies. We studied 1,677 individuals, including subjective cognitive decline (SCD, n=255), mild cognitive impairment (MCI, n=400), all cause dementia (n=393), and cognitively normal controls (n=625) from the BioFINDER-2 cohort (median age [IQR]=72.0 [16.2] years; 50.3% female). The Subtype and Stage Inference (SuStaIn) model was applied to biomarkers of amyloid-β (Aβ) (cerebrospinal fluid [CSF] Aβ42/Aβ40), tau (temporal meta-ROI positron emission tomography [PET]), neuronal α-synuclein (CSF seed amplification assay [SAA]), vascular pathology (MRI-based white matter hyperintensities [WMHs]), and regional atrophy (MRI-based cortical thickness) to identify biomarker-based clusters across the entire dataset. We then applied this framework to cognitively symptomatic individuals (n=788) to compare clinical symptoms, disease progression rate, and brain changes (atrophy and functional connectivity) across profiles. We identified five biomarker clusters reflecting established clinico-pathological entities, closely corresponding to (i) Alzheimer's disease (AD, n=317 [40.2%]); (ii) α-Synuclein disease (αSyn, n=123 [15.6%]), (iii) Vascular disease (n=67 [8.5%]); (iv) Mixed AD and Vascular diseases (Mixed, n=207 [26.3%]); and (v) a heterogenous group of individuals characterized by atrophy without any of the major brain pathologies, here termed Non-Vascular-Alzheimer-Synuclein (NOVAS, n=74 [9.4%]). The AD profile was characterized by global cognitive impairment and cortical atrophy in AD-associated regions. The αSyn profile was associated with visuospatial and executive dysfunction, motor impairment, hallucinations, and functional connectivity disruptions throughout the brain, despite less overall atrophy compared to all others. The Vascular profile showed language and motor impairments and both the Vascular and Mixed profiles demonstrated atrophy in cingulate and subcortical regions, alongside reduced periventricular white matter integrity. The NOVAS profile was older, demonstrated pronounced hippocampal and amygdala atrophy, and baseline memory deficits, possibly reflecting neurodegenerative diseases for which currently no robust biomarkers are available, such as primary tauopathies and TDP-43 proteinopathies (e.g. LATE). In longitudinal analyses, the AD profile showed the fastest global cognitive decline, while αSyn demonstrated an accelerated decline in language, executive, and visuospatial functioning. To conclude, classifying individuals using a multimodal biomarker approach can provide valuable diagnostic and prognostic insights, with potential implications for clinical trials.	amyloid-β; biological framework; data-driven; tau; vascular; α-synuclein

Reference proteins to improve Core 1 and Core 2 Alzheimer's disease CSF and plasma biomarkers.	Concentration-based fluid biomarkers represent an informative and cost-effective way to detect and monitor Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. However, non-AD-related inter-individual variation in biofluids can also affect biomarker concentrations. Here, we investigated whether normalization of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma biomarkers to reference proteins, such as amyloid-β40 (Aβ40) and non-phosphorylated mid-region tau (np-tau), improves their robustness and reliability of representing AD pathology load. Using the Swedish BioFINDER-2 cohort (n=1702, 50.7% male, mean [SD] age 68.4 [12.2] years), we compared the associations between tau/Aβ-PET load and fluid biomarkers alone versus in a ratio with a reference protein (Aβ40 or np-tau) in univariate linear regression models. Fluid biomarkers included CSF and plasma measures of p-tau217, p-tau181, p-tau205, np-tau181-190, np-tau195-210, np-tau212-221, Aβ42, Aβ40, and CSF MTBR-tau243, SNAP-25, neurogranin, YKL-40, sTREM2, and plasma eMTBR-tau243. Biomarkers were measured with mass spectrometry assays and/or immunoassays. In addition, we performed validation and extended analyses, comparing for example group-level diagnostic differences and longitudinal biomarker trajectories, in three independent prospective cohorts: BioFINDER-1, Knight Alzheimer Disease Research Center (ADRC), and Translational Biomarkers in Aging and Dementia (TRIAD), as well as in an Italian multiple sclerosis cohort. CSF Aβ40 normalization significantly strengthened the associations of several core CSF AD biomarkers, including CSF MTBR-tau243, p-tau isoforms and synaptic biomarkers, with tau-PET (ΔR²=0.064-0.24) and Aβ-PET (ΔR² = 0.016-0.28). Normalization to CSF np-tau mainly improved concordance with Aβ-PET (ΔR² = -0.0059-0.19). The strongest association with tau-PET was observed for MTBR-tau243/Aβ40 (R² = 0.78, compared to 0.65 for non-normalized MTBR-tau243), and with Aβ-PET for p-tau217/np-tau (R² = 0.65, compared to 0.46 for non-normalized p-tau217). Plasma biomarker associations with tau-PET improved when using normalization to plasma Aβ40 or np-tau (ΔR² = 0.004-0.14), with the strongest effect for eMTBR-tau243/np-tau (R² = 0.72 versus 0.60). Associations with Aβ-PET were enhanced with np-tau normalization (ΔR² = 0.018-0.16, strongest for p-tau217/np-tau: R² = 0.62 versus 0.53). The results were replicated in Knight ADRC and TRIAD. Furthermore, longitudinal analyses showed that Aβ40 normalization typically reduced inter-individual rather than intra-individual variability over time. Normalization did not enhance group-level differences in inflammatory CSF biomarkers in AD, nor did it improve biomarker associations in the multiple sclerosis cohort. In conclusion, normalization of CSF and plasma biomarkers to reference proteins, such as Aβ40 or np-tau, enhances their association with brain tau and Aβ pathology, making already high-performing AD fluid biomarkers even more accurate.

Hemispheric asymmetry of tau pathology is related to asymmetric amyloid deposition in Alzheimer's Disease.	The distribution of tau pathology in Alzheimer's disease (AD) shows remarkable inter-individual heterogeneity, including hemispheric asymmetry. However, the factors driving this asymmetry remain poorly understood. Here we explore whether tau asymmetry is linked to i) reduced inter-hemispheric brain connectivity (potentially restricting tau spread), or ii) asymmetry in amyloid-beta (Aβ) distribution (indicating greater hemisphere-specific vulnerability to AD pathology). We include 452 participants from the Swedish BioFINDER-2 cohort with evidence of both Aβ pathology (CSF Aβ42/40 or neocortical Aβ-PET) and tau pathology (temporal tau-PET), categorising them as left asymmetric (n = 102), symmetric (n = 306), or right asymmetric (n = 44) based on temporal lobe tau-PET uptake distribution. We assess edge-wise inter-hemispheric functional (RSfMRI; n = 318) and structural connectivity (dMRI; n = 352) but find no association between tau asymmetry and connectivity. In contrast, we observe a strong association between tau and Aβ laterality patterns based on PET uptake (n = 233; β = 0.632, p < 0.001), which we replicate in three independent cohorts (n = 234; β = 0.535, p < 0.001). In a longitudinal Aβ-positive sample, we show that baseline Aβ asymmetry predicts progression of tau laterality over time (n = 289; β = 0.025, p = 0.028). These findings suggest that tau asymmetry is not associated with a weaker inter-hemispheric connectivity but might reflect hemispheric differences in vulnerability to Aβ pathology, underscoring the role of regional vulnerability in determining the distribution of AD pathology.

Association of plasma Alzheimer's disease biomarkers with cognitive decline in cognitively unimpaired individuals.	INTRODUCTION: Plasma biomarkers' utility for predicting incident mild cognitive impairment (MCI) remains unclear. We evaluated associations of plasma Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers and amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) with transitions from cognitively unimpaired (CU) to MCI in the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging (MCSA) and BioFINDER-2 studies. METHODS: Associations of continuous baseline plasma biomarker levels and amyloid PET Centiloid with progression to MCI, adjusting for age, sex, and education, were evaluated with Cox proportional hazards models. RESULTS: The study included 381 MCSA and 584 BioFINDER-2 participants. Amyloid PET and percent phosphorylated to non-phosphorylated tau217 (%p-tau217) were strong predictors of progression to MCI in both cohorts: hazard ratios of 1.49 and 1.23 in the MCSA and 1.72 and 1.65 in BioFINDER, respectively. Amyloid beta 42/40 was a significant predictor in BioFINDER-2 only (hazard ratio 2.20). DISCUSSION: Plasma %p-tau217 was associated with progression from CU to MCI in both cohorts, although differences in biomarker associations may be related to differences in the two cohorts. HIGHLIGHTS: Mass-spectrometry-based plasma phosphorylated tau217 was associated with cognitively unimpaired to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) progression. Plasma amyloid beta 42/40 was a significant predictor in BioFINDER but not the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging (MCSA). Amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) was the strongest predictor of progression to MCI in the MCSA. Plasma had added value to amyloid PET in BioFINDER but not the MCSA. Biomarker performance may vary with cohort and biomarker measurement differences.

Clinical Performance of the Elecsys CSF pTau	INTRODUCTION: Amyloid- and tau-positron emission tomography (PET) are promising modalities for detecting pathological changes associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD); however, their application is limited. Although the use of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers as alternatives to amyloid-PET and tau-PET has been explored, no in vitro diagnostic-approved or commercial CSF biomarker assays are currently available for detecting tau pathology in clinical practice.

Longitudinal tau aggregation, atrophy, and cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease.	INTRODUCTION: The independent contributions of baseline and longitudinal tau positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to cognitive decline remain unclear. METHODS: We included n = 761 amyloid-positive individuals from the Swedish BioFINDER-2 study with [ RESULTS: Tau-PET showed stronger associations with cognitive decline than MRI, showing the strongest associations in a neocortical-composite-region with a cognitive composite (β = -0.25 ± 0.02, p < 0.001) for baseline and longitudinal tau-PET (β = -0.62 ± 0.05, p < 0.001). Baseline tau-PET explained the largest proportion of cognitive decline (54.0%-94.0%), with modest mediation effects for longitudinal tau-PET or MRI pathways (2.0%-15.0%). Simulated reductions of tau-PET-slopes (up to 100%) were associated with marginally altered cognitive trajectories. DISCUSSION: The strong associations between baseline tau-PET and longitudinal cognition, with marginal contributions of longitudinal tau-PET and MRI, emphasize the importance of baseline tau aggregates for prognostics and treatments in Alzheimer's disease (AD). HIGHLIGHTS: Baseline and longitudinal regional tau-PET uptake were more closely associated than structural MRI with longitudinal cognitive decline. Baseline tau-PET was a stronger determinant of longitudinal cognitive decline than longitudinal tau-PET. Simulated reductions of tau-PET accumulation showed limited alterations of cognitive trajectories, with potential implications for tau-targeting therapies.

Evaluation of the Revised Criteria for Biological and Clinical Staging of Alzheimer Disease.	IMPORTANCE: While clinical disease stages remained largely unchanged in the 2024 update of the Alzheimer disease (AD) criteria, tau-positron emission tomography (PET) was introduced as a core biomarker and its spatial extent was incorporated into the revised biological stages of the disease. It is important to consider both the clinical and the biological stages and understand their discrepancies. OBJECTIVE: To compare individuals who have discrepant biological and clinical stages with those who have congruent stages in terms of copathologies, comorbidities, and demographics. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Participants were from the Swedish BioFINDER-2 (inclusion from 2017 through 2023) and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) (inclusion from 2015 through 2024). BioFINDER-2 included a prospective population-based (cognitively normal [CN] older adults) and memory clinic-based cohort (participants with subjective cognitive impairment [SCD], mild cognitive impairment [MCI], and dementia). ADNI included a volunteer-based sample. All participants who were amyloid-β positive and had undergone tau-PET were included. In BioFINDER-2, 838 participants of a total of 1979 were included, and of 927 with tau-PET in ADNI, 380 were included. EXPOSURES: The clinical (CN to dementia) and biological (based on PET; initial [amyloid-β-positive only] to advanced [amyloid-β-positive, elevated, and widespread tau]) stages from the revised AD criteria. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Cross-sectional measures of neurodegeneration (cortical thickness, TAR DNA-binding protein 43 [TDP-43] imaging signature, neurofilament light [NfL]), α-synuclein cerebrospinal fluid status, plasma glial fibrillary acidic protein, white matter lesions, infarcts, microbleeds, comorbidities, and demographics. RESULTS: There were 838 BioFINDER-2 participants (mean age, 73.9 [SD, 7.3] years; 431 women [51%]; 407 men [49%]) and 380 ADNI participants (average age, 72.9 [SD, 7.0] years; 194 women [51%]; 186 mean [49%]) included. In BioFINDER-2, 37.7% of the sample had congruent biological and clinical stages (reference group), 51.3% had more advanced clinical impairment compared with their clinical stage (clinical > biological) and 11.0% had the opposite (biological > clinical). The main differences were between the reference group and the clinical > biological group: the latter participants were more often positive for α-synuclein pathology, had higher NfL levels, greater TDP-43-like atrophy, and higher burden of cerebral small vessel disease lesions (all false discovery rate P < .05). The only difference between the biological > clinical and the reference group was that the former had less neurodegeneration (thicker cortex; all false discovery rate P < .001). The main results were replicated in the independent ADNI cohort, where congruent 56.1% of participants had biological and clinical stages; 36.1% were in the category clinical > biological, and 7.9% in biological > clinical. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Copathologies play an important role in symptom severity in individuals who harbor less tau-tangle pathology than expected for their clinical impairment. These results highlight the importance of measuring non-AD biomarkers in patients with AD with worse cognitive impairment than expected based on their biological stage, which could impact the clinical diagnosis and prognosis.

Plasma phosphorylated tau217 strongly associates with memory deficits in the Alzheimer's disease spectrum.	Plasma phosphorylated tau (p-tau) biomarkers open unprecedented opportunities for identifying carriers of Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology in early disease stages using minimally invasive techniques. Plasma p-tau biomarkers are believed to reflect tau phosphorylation and secretion. However, it remains unclear to what extent the magnitude of plasma p-tau abnormalities reflects neuronal network disturbance in the form of cognitive impairment. To address this question, we included 103 cognitively unimpaired elderly and 40 cognitively impaired, amyloid-β-positive individuals from the TRIAD cohort, in addition to 336 cognitively unimpaired and 216 cognitively impaired, amyloid-β-positive older adults from the BioFINDER-2 cohort. Participants had tau PET scans, amyloid PET scans or amyloid CSF, p-tau217, p-tau181 and p-tau231 blood measures, structural T1-MRI and cognitive assessments. In this cross-sectional study, we used regression models and correlation analyses to assess the relationship between plasma biomarkers and cognitive scores. Furthermore, we applied receiver operating characteristic curves to assess cognitive impairment across plasma biomarkers. Finally, we categorized participants into amyloid (A), p-tau (T1) and tau PET (T2) positive (+) or negative (-) profiles and ran non-parametric comparisons to assess differences across cognitive domains. We found that plasma p-tau217 was more associated with cognitive performance than p-tau181 and p-tau231 and that this relationship was particularly strong for memory scores (TRIAD: βp-tau217 = -0.53, βp-tau181 = -0.35 and βp-tau231 = -0.24; BioFINDER-2: βp-tau217 = -0.52, βp-tau181 = -0.24 and βp-tau231 = -0.29). Associations in amyloid-β-positive participants resembled these results, but other cognitive scores also showed strong associations in cognitively impaired individuals. Moreover, plasma p-tau217 outperformed plasma p-tau181 and plasma p-tau231 in identifying memory impairment (area under the curve values for TRIAD: p-tau217 = 0.86, p-tau181 = 0.77 and p-tau231 = 0.75; and for BioFINDER-2: p-tau217 = 0.86, p-tau181 = 0.76 and p-tau231 = 0.81) and in identifying executive function impairment only in the BioFINDER-2 cohort (p-tau217 = 0.82, p-tau181 = 0.76 and p-tau231 = 0.76). Lastly, we showed that subtle memory deficits were present in A+T1+T2- participants for plasma p-tau217 (P = 0.007) and plasma p-tau181 (P = 0.01) in the TRIAD cohort and for all biomarkers across cognitive domains in A+T1+T2- and A+T1+T2- individuals (P < 0.001 in all) in the BioFINDER-2 cohort. The A+T1+T2- individuals showed cognitive deficits in both cohorts (P < 0.001 in all). Together, our results suggest that plasma p-tau217 stands out as a biomarker capable of identifying memory deficits attributable to Alzheimer's disease and that memory impairment certainly occurs in amyloid-β- and plasma p-tau-positive individuals who have no significant amounts of tau in the neocortex.

APOE4 impact on soluble and insoluble tau pathology is mostly influenced by amyloid-β.	The APOE4 allele is the strongest genetic risk factor for sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although APOE4 is strongly associated with amyloid-β (Aβ), its relationship with tau accumulation is less understood. Studies evaluating the role of APOE4 on tau accumulation showed conflicting results, particularly regarding the independence of these associations from Aβ load. In this study, we examined three independent longitudinal cohorts (BioFINDER-1, BioFINDER-2 and WRAP), in which participants had cross-sectional and longitudinal measures of tau tangles [tau-PET; temporal meta-region of interest (meta-ROI) and entorhinal] or soluble p-tau (p-tau217), Aβ-PET and APOE genotype. The study included a total of 1370 cognitively unimpaired subjects and 449 with mild cognitive impairment, followed longitudinally with tau-PET and p-tau217. APOE4 carriers accounted for 40.2%-50% of the cohorts. Different linear regressions (cross-sectional) and linear mixed-effect models (longitudinal) with tau measures as outcomes were fitted to test the effect of APOE4 both as an independent predictor and in combination with baseline Aβ load (including interaction). All models included age, sex and cognitive status as covariates. We found no independent effects of APOE4 carriership on insoluble tau in either cohort (BioFINDER-2 or WRAP), on both cross-sectional and longitudinal tau-PET in the temporal meta-ROI, when Aβ was present in the model (P = 0.531-0.949). Aβ alone was the best predictor of insoluble tau accumulation, with no interaction between APOE4 and Aβ on tau-PET. In BioFINDER-2, there was a significant interaction between APOE4 and Aβ (b = 0.166, P < 0.001) in the entorhinal cortex at baseline. However, the interaction was not present in WRAP PET. No independent effects of the APOE4 carriership on baseline (P = 0.683-0.708) and longitudinal (P = 0.188-0.570) soluble p-tau217 were observed when Aβ was included in the model in BioFINDER-1 and WRAP. Likewise, no interaction between APOE4 and Aβ on soluble p-tau217 was observed. Mediation analysis revealed that Aβ load fully mediated most associations between APOE4 and tau (46%-112%, either cross-sectional or longitudinal tau-PET or soluble p-tau217). In the largest cohort (BioFINDER-2), looking at APOE4 groups by the number of ε4 alleles, we found an interaction between APOE4 homozygotes and Aβ on tau-PET levels at baseline and over time in the temporal meta-ROI, whereas in the entorhinal cortex this effect was observed only at baseline. In conclusion, although APOE4 is strongly associated with Aβ aggregation, it seems to be associated minimally with longitudinal changes in soluble or insoluble p-tau levels at a given level of Aβ pathology, confirming the primacy of Aβ in driving tau pathology.

A comprehensive head-to-head comparison of key plasma phosphorylated tau 217 biomarker tests.	Plasma phosphorylated-tau 217 (p-tau217) is currently the most promising biomarker for reliable detection of Alzheimer's disease pathology. Various p-tau217 assays have been developed, but their relative performance is unclear. We compared key plasma p-tau217 tests using cross-sectional and longitudinal measures of amyloid-β (Aβ)-PET, tau-PET and cognition as outcomes and benchmarked them against CSF biomarker tests. Samples from 998 individuals [mean (range) age 68.5 (20.0-92.5) years, 53% female] from the Swedish BioFINDER-2 cohort, including both cognitively unimpaired and cognitively impaired individuals, were analysed. Plasma p-tau217 was measured with mass spectrometry assays [the ratio between phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated (%p-tau217WashU) and p-tau217WashU] and with immunoassays (p-tau217Lilly, p-tau217Janssen and p-tau217ALZpath). CSF biomarkers included p-tau217Lilly, the US Food and Drug Administration-approved p-tau181/Aβ42Elecsys, and p-tau181Elecsys. All plasma p-tau217 tests exhibited a high ability to detect abnormal Aβ-PET [area under the curve (AUC) range: 0.91-0.96] and tau-PET (AUC range: 0.94-0.97). Plasma %p-tau217WashU had the highest performance, with significantly higher AUCs than all the immunoassays (Pdiff < 0.007). For detecting Aβ-PET status, %p-tau217WashU had an accuracy of 0.93 (immunoassays: 0.83-0.88), sensitivity of 0.91 (immunoassays: 0.84-0.87) and a specificity of 0.94 (immunoassays: 0.85-0.89). Among immunoassays, p-tau217Lilly and plasma p-tau217ALZpath had higher AUCs than plasma p-tau217Janssen for Aβ-PET status (Pdiff < 0.006), and p-tau217Lilly outperformed plasma p-tau217ALZpath for tau-PET status (Pdiff = 0.025). Plasma %p-tau217WashU exhibited stronger associations with all PET load outcomes compared with immunoassays; baseline Aβ-PET load (R2: 0.72; immunoassays: 0.47-0.58; Pdiff < 0.001), baseline tau-PET load (R2: 0.51; immunoassays: 0.38-0.45; Pdiff < 0.001), longitudinal Aβ-PET load (R2: 0.53; immunoassays: 0.31-0.38; Pdiff < 0.001) and longitudinal tau-PET load (R2: 0.50; immunoassays: 0.35-0.43; Pdiff < 0.014). Among immunoassays, plasma p-tau217Lilly was more associated with Aβ-PET load than plasma p-tau217Janssen (Pdiff < 0.020) and with tau-PET load than both plasma p-tau217Janssen and plasma p-tau217ALZpath (all Pdiff < 0.010). Plasma %p-tau217 also correlated more strongly with baseline cognition (Mini-Mental State Examination) than all immunoassays (R2: %p-tau217WashU: 0.33; immunoassays: 0.27-0.30; Pdiff < 0.024). The main results were replicated in an external cohort from Washington University in St Louis (n = 219). Finally, p-tau217NULISA showed similar performance to other immunoassays in subsets of both cohorts. In summary, both mass spectrometry- and immunoassay-based p-tau217 tests generally perform well in identifying Aβ-PET, tau-PET and cognitive abnormalities, but %p-tau217WashU performed significantly better than all the examined immunoassays. Plasma %p-tau217 may be considered as a stand-alone confirmatory test for Alzheimer's disease pathology, whereas some immunoassays might be better suited as triage tests where positive results are confirmed with a second test, which needs to be determined by future reviews incorporating results from multiple cohorts.

Biological mechanisms of resilience to tau pathology in Alzheimer's disease.	BACKGROUND: In Alzheimer's disease (AD), the associations between tau pathology and brain atrophy and cognitive decline are well established, but imperfect. We investigate whether cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers of biological processes (vascular, synaptic, and axonal integrity, neuroinflammation, neurotrophic factors) explain the disconnection between tau pathology and brain atrophy (brain resilience), and tau pathology and cognitive decline (cognitive resilience). METHODS: We included 428 amyloid positive participants (134 cognitively unimpaired (CU), 128 with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), 166 with AD dementia) from the BioFINDER-2 study. At baseline, participants underwent tau positron emission tomography (tau-PET), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), cognitive testing, and lumbar puncture. Longitudinal data were available for MRI (mean (standard deviation) follow-up 26.4 (10.7) months) and cognition (25.2 (11.4) months). We analysed 18 pre-selected CSF proteins, reflecting vascular, synaptic, and axonal integrity, neuroinflammation, and neurotrophic factors. Stratifying by cognitive status, we performed linear mixed-effects models with cortical thickness (brain resilience) and global cognition (cognitive resilience) as dependent variables to assess whether the CSF biomarkers interacted with tau-PET levels in its effect on cortical atrophy and cognitive decline. RESULTS: Regarding brain resilience, interaction effects were observed in AD dementia, with vascular integrity biomarkers (VEGF-A (β CONCLUSIONS: Biomarkers of co-existing pathological processes, in particular vascular pathology and axonal degeneration, interact with levels of tau pathology on its association with the downstream effects of AD pathology (i.e. brain atrophy and cognitive decline). This indicates that vascular pathology and axonal degeneration could impact brain and cognitive resilience.	Alzheimer’s disease; Brain resilience; Cognitive resilience; Tau

Yet, detailed examination of MTL subfields and drivers of atrophy in amnestic EOAD is lacking. METHODS: BioFINDER-2 participants with memory impairment, abnormal amyloid-β and tau-PET were included. Forty-one amnestic EOAD individuals ≤65 years and, as comparison, late-onset AD (aLOAD, ≥70 years, n = 154) and amyloid-β-negative cognitively unimpaired controls were included. MTL subregions and biomarkers of (co-)pathologies were measured. RESULTS: AD groups showed smaller MTL subregions compared to controls. Atrophy patterns were similar across AD groups: aLOAD showed thinner entorhinal cortices than aEOAD; aEOAD showed thinner parietal regions than aLOAD. aEOAD showed lower white matter hyperintensities than aLOAD. No differences in MTL tau-PET or transactive response DNA binding protein 43-proxy positivity were found. CONCLUSIONS: We found evidence for MTL atrophy in amnestic EOAD and overall similar levels to aLOAD of MTL tau pathology and co-pathologies.

MRI Signature of α-Synuclein Pathology in Asymptomatic Stages and a Memory Clinic Population.	IMPORTANCE: The lack of an in vivo measure for α-synuclein (α-syn) pathology until recently has limited thorough characterization of its brain atrophy pattern, especially during early disease stages. OBJECTIVE: To assess the association of state-of-the-art cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) seed amplification assays (SAA) α-syn positivity (SAA α-syn+) with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) structural measures, across the continuum from clinically unimpaired (CU) to cognitively impaired (CI) individuals, in 3 independent cohorts, and separately in CU and CI individuals, the latter reflecting a memory clinic population. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Cross-sectional data were used from the Swedish BioFINDER-2 study (inclusion, 2017-2023) as the discovery cohort and the Swedish BioFINDER-1 study (inclusion, 2007-2015) and Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI; inclusion 2005-2022) as replication cohorts. All cohorts are from multicenter studies, but the BioFINDER cohorts used 1 MRI scanner. CU and CI individuals fulfilling inclusion criteria and without missing data points in relevant metrics were included in the study. All analyses were performed from 2023 to 2024. EXPOSURES: Presence of α-syn pathology, estimated by baseline CSF SAA α-syn. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcomes were cross-sectional structural MRI measures either through voxel-based morphometry (VBM) or regions of interest (ROI) including an automated pipeline for cholinergic basal forebrain nuclei CH4/4p (nucleus basalis of Meynert [NBM]) and CH1/2/3. Secondary outcomes were domain-specific cross-sectional cognitive measures. Analyses were adjusted for CSF biomarkers of Alzheimer pathology. RESULTS: A total of 2961 participants were included in this study: 1388 (mean [SD] age, 71 [10] years; 702 female [51%]) from the BioFINDER-2 study, 752 (mean [SD] age, 72 [6] years; 406 female [54%]) from the BioFINDER-1 study, and 821 (mean [SD] age, 75 [8] years; 449 male [55%]) from ADNI. In the BioFINDER-2 study, VBM analyses in the whole cohort revealed a specific association between SAA α-syn+ and the cholinergic NBM, even when adjusting for Alzheimer copathology. ROI-based analyses in the BioFINDER-2 study focused on regions involved in the cholinergic system and confirmed that SAA α-syn+ was indeed independently associated with smaller NBM (β = -0.271; 95% CI, -0.399 to -0.142; P <.001) and CH1/2/3 volumes (β = -0.227; 95% CI, -0.377 to -0.076; P =.02). SAA α-syn+ was also independently associated with smaller NBM volumes in the separate CU (β = -0.360; 95% CI, -0.603 to -0.117; P =.03) and CI (β = -0.251; 95% CI, -0.408 to -0.095; P =.02) groups. Overall, the association between SAA α-syn+ and NBM volume was replicated in the BioFINDER-1 study and ADNI cohort. In CI individuals, NBM volumes partially mediated the association of SAA α-syn+ with attention/executive impairments in all cohorts (BioFINDER-2, β = -0.017; proportion-mediated effect, 7%; P =.04; BioFINDER-1, β = -0.096; proportion-mediated effect, 19%; P =.04; ADNI, β = -0.061; proportion-mediated effect, 20%; P =.007). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study, SAA α-syn+ was consistently associated with NBM atrophy already during asymptomatic stages. Further, in memory clinic CI populations, SAA α-syn+ was associated with NBM atrophy, which partially mediated α-syn-induced attention/executive impairment.

A Comprehensive Head-to-Head Comparison of Key Plasma Phosphorylated Tau 217 Biomarker Tests.	Plasma phosphorylated-tau 217 (p-tau217) is currently the most promising biomarkers for reliable detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. Various p-tau217 assays have been developed, but their relative performance is unclear. We compared key plasma p-tau217 tests using cross-sectional and longitudinal measures of amyloid-β (Aβ)-PET, tau-PET, and cognition as outcomes, and benchmarked them against cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker tests. Samples from 998 individuals (mean[range] age 68.5[20.0-92.5], 53% female) from the Swedish BioFINDER-2 cohort were analyzed.

A generalizable data-driven model of atrophy heterogeneity and progression in memory clinic settings.	Memory clinic patients are a heterogeneous population representing various aetiologies of pathological ageing. It is not known whether divergent spatiotemporal progression patterns of brain atrophy, as previously described in Alzheimer's disease patients, are prevalent and clinically meaningful in this group of older adults. To uncover distinct atrophy subtypes, we applied the Subtype and Stage Inference (SuStaIn) algorithm to baseline structural MRI data from 813 participants enrolled in the DELCODE cohort (mean ± standard deviation, age = 70.67 ± 6.07 years, 52% females). Participants were cognitively unimpaired (n = 285) or fulfilled diagnostic criteria for subjective cognitive decline (n = 342), mild cognitive impairment (n = 118) or dementia of the Alzheimer's type (n = 68). Atrophy subtypes were compared in baseline demographics, fluid Alzheimer's disease biomarker levels, the Preclinical Alzheimer Cognitive Composite (PACC-5) as well as episodic memory and executive functioning. PACC-5 trajectories over up to 240 weeks were examined. To test whether baseline atrophy subtype and stage predicted clinical trajectories before manifest cognitive impairment, we analysed PACC-5 trajectories and mild cognitive impairment conversion rates of cognitively unimpaired participants and those with subjective cognitive decline. Limbic-predominant and hippocampal-sparing atrophy subtypes were identified. Limbic-predominant atrophy initially affected the medial temporal lobes, followed by further temporal regions and, finally, the remaining cortical regions. At baseline, this subtype was related to older age, more pathological Alzheimer's disease biomarker levels, APOE ε4 carriership and an amnestic cognitive impairment. Hippocampal-sparing atrophy initially occurred outside the temporal lobe, with the medial temporal lobe spared up to advanced atrophy stages. This atrophy pattern also affected individuals with positive Alzheimer's disease biomarkers and was associated with more generalized cognitive impairment. Limbic-predominant atrophy, in all participants and in only unimpaired participants, was linked to more negative longitudinal PACC-5 slopes than observed in participants without or with hippocampal-sparing atrophy and increased the risk of mild cognitive impairment conversion. SuStaIn modelling was repeated in a sample from the Swedish BioFINDER-2 cohort. Highly similar atrophy progression patterns and associated cognitive profiles were identified. Cross-cohort model generalizability, at both the subject and the group level, was excellent, indicating reliable performance in previously unseen data. The proposed model is a promising tool for capturing heterogeneity among older adults at early at-risk states for Alzheimer's disease in applied settings. The implementation of atrophy subtype- and stage-specific end points might increase the statistical power of pharmacological trials targeting early Alzheimer's disease.

Disease staging of Alzheimer's disease using a CSF-based biomarker model.	Biological staging of individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD) may improve diagnostic and prognostic workup of dementia in clinical practice and the design of clinical trials. In this study, we used the Subtype and Stage Inference (SuStaIn) algorithm to establish a robust biological staging model for AD using cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers. Our analysis involved 426 participants from BioFINDER-2 and was validated in 222 participants from the Knight Alzheimer Disease Research Center cohort. SuStaIn identified a singular biomarker sequence and revealed that five CSF biomarkers effectively constituted a reliable staging model (ordered: Aβ42/40, pT217/T217, pT205/T205, MTBR-tau243 and non-phosphorylated mid-region tau). The CSF stages (0-5) demonstrated a correlation with increased abnormalities in other AD-related biomarkers, such as Aβ-PET and tau-PET, and aligned with longitudinal biomarker changes reflective of AD progression. Higher CSF stages at baseline were associated with an elevated hazard ratio of clinical decline. This study highlights a common molecular pathway underlying AD pathophysiology across all patients, suggesting that a single CSF collection can accurately indicate the presence of AD pathologies and characterize the stage of disease progression. The proposed staging model has implications for enhancing diagnostic and prognostic assessments in both clinical practice and the design of clinical trials.

A blood-based biomarker workflow for optimal tau-PET referral in memory clinic settings.	"Blood-based biomarkers for screening may guide tau positrion emissition tomography (PET) scan referrals to optimize prognostic evaluation in Alzheimer's disease. Plasma Aβ42/Aβ40, pTau181, pTau217, pTau231, NfL, and GFAP were measured along with tau-PET in memory clinic patients with subjective cognitive decline, mild cognitive impairment or dementia, in the Swedish BioFINDER-2 study (n = 548) and in the TRIAD study (n = 179). For each plasma biomarker, cutoffs were determined for 90%, 95%, or 97.5% sensitivity to detect tau-PET-positivity. We calculated the percentage of patients below the cutoffs (who would not undergo tau-PET; ""saved scans"") and the tau-PET-positivity rate among participants above the cutoffs (who would undergo tau-PET; ""positive predictive value""). Generally, plasma pTau217 performed best. At the 95% sensitivity cutoff in both cohorts, pTau217 resulted in avoiding nearly half tau-PET scans, with a tau-PET-positivity rate among those who would be referred for a scan around 70%. And although tau-PET was strongly associated with subsequent cognitive decline, in BioFINDER-2 it predicted cognitive decline only among individuals above the referral cutoff on plasma pTau217, supporting that this workflow could reduce prognostically uninformative tau-PET scans. In conclusion, plasma pTau217 may guide selection of patients for tau-PET, when accurate prognostic information is of clinical value."

Highly accurate blood test for Alzheimer's disease is similar or superior to clinical cerebrospinal fluid tests.	With the emergence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) disease-modifying therapies, identifying patients who could benefit from these treatments becomes critical. In this study, we evaluated whether a precise blood test could perform as well as established cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tests in detecting amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and tau tangles. Plasma %p-tau217 (ratio of phosporylated-tau217 to non-phosphorylated tau) was analyzed by mass spectrometry in the Swedish BioFINDER-2 cohort (n = 1,422) and the US Charles F. and Joanne Knight Alzheimer Disease Research Center (Knight ADRC) cohort (n = 337). Matched CSF samples were analyzed with clinically used and FDA-approved automated immunoassays for Aβ42/40 and p-tau181/Aβ42. The primary and secondary outcomes were detection of brain Aβ or tau pathology, respectively, using positron emission tomography (PET) imaging as the reference standard. Main analyses were focused on individuals with cognitive impairment (mild cognitive impairment and mild dementia), which is the target population for available disease-modifying treatments. Plasma %p-tau217 was clinically equivalent to FDA-approved CSF tests in classifying Aβ PET status, with an area under the curve (AUC) for both between 0.95 and 0.97. Plasma %p-tau217 was generally superior to CSF tests in classification of tau-PET with AUCs of 0.95-0.98. In cognitively impaired subcohorts (BioFINDER-2: n = 720; Knight ADRC: n = 50), plasma %p-tau217 had an accuracy, a positive predictive value and a negative predictive value of 89-90% for Aβ PET and 87-88% for tau PET status, which was clinically equivalent to CSF tests, further improving to 95% using a two-cutoffs approach. Blood plasma %p-tau217 demonstrated performance that was clinically equivalent or superior to clinically used FDA-approved CSF tests in the detection of AD pathology. Use of high-performance blood tests in clinical practice can improve access to accurate AD diagnosis and AD-specific treatments.

Plasma N-terminal containing tau fragments (NTA-tau): a biomarker of tau deposition in Alzheimer's Disease.	BACKGROUND: Novel phosphorylated-tau (p-tau) blood biomarkers (e.g., p-tau181, p-tau217 or p-tau231), are highly specific for Alzheimer's disease (AD), and can track amyloid-β (Aβ) and tau pathology. However, because these biomarkers are strongly associated with the emergence of Aβ pathology, it is difficult to determine the contribution of insoluble tau aggregates to the plasma p-tau signal in blood. Therefore, there remains a need for a biomarker capable of specifically tracking insoluble tau accumulation in brain. METHODS: NTA is a novel ultrasensitive assay targeting N-terminal containing tau fragments (NTA-tau) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma, which is elevated in AD. Using two well-characterized research cohorts (BioFINDER-2, n = 1,294, and BioFINDER-1, n = 932), we investigated the association between plasma NTA-tau levels and disease progression in AD, including tau accumulation, brain atrophy and cognitive decline. RESULTS: We demonstrate that plasma NTA-tau increases across the AD continuum¸ especially during late stages, and displays a moderate-to-strong association with tau-PET (β = 0.54, p < 0.001) in Aβ-positive participants, while weak with Aβ-PET (β = 0.28, p < 0.001). Unlike plasma p-tau181, GFAP, NfL and t-tau, tau pathology determined with tau-PET is the most prominent contributor to NTA-tau variance (52.5% of total R CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that plasma NTA-tau levels increase across the AD continuum, especially during mid-to-late AD stages, and it is closely associated with in vivo tau tangle deposition in AD and its downstream effects. Moreover, this novel biomarker has potential as a cost-effective and easily accessible tool for monitoring disease progression and cognitive decline in clinical settings, and as an outcome measure in clinical trials which also need to assess the downstream effects of successful Aβ removal.

Cerebrospinal fluid biomarker panel for synaptic dysfunction in a broad spectrum of neurodegenerative diseases.	Synaptic dysfunction and degeneration is likely the key pathophysiology for the progression of cognitive decline in various dementia disorders. Synaptic status can be monitored by measuring synaptic proteins in CSF. In this study, both known and new synaptic proteins were investigated and compared as potential biomarkers of synaptic dysfunction, particularly in the context of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Seventeen synaptic proteins were quantified in CSF using two different targeted mass spectrometry assays in the prospective Swedish BioFINDER-2 study. The study included 958 individuals, characterized as having mild cognitive impairment (MCI, n = 205), AD dementia (n = 149) and a spectrum of other neurodegenerative diseases (n = 171), in addition to cognitively unimpaired individuals (CU, n = 443). Synaptic protein levels were compared between diagnostic groups and their associations with cognitive decline and key neuroimaging measures (amyloid-β-PET, tau-PET and cortical thickness) were assessed. Among the 17 synaptic proteins examined, 14 were specifically elevated in the AD continuum. SNAP-25, 14-3-3 zeta/delta, β-synuclein, and neurogranin exhibited the highest discriminatory accuracy in differentiating AD dementia from controls (areas under the curve = 0.81-0.93). SNAP-25 and 14-3-3 zeta/delta also had the strongest associations with tau-PET, amyloid-β-PET and cortical thickness at baseline and were associated with longitudinal changes in these imaging biomarkers [β(standard error, SE) = -0.056(0.0006) to 0.058(0.005), P < 0.0001]. SNAP-25 was the strongest predictor of progression to AD dementia in non-demented individuals (hazard ratio = 2.11). In contrast, neuronal pentraxins were decreased in all neurodegenerative diseases (except for Parkinson's disease), and NPTX2 showed the strongest associations with subsequent cognitive decline [longitudinal Mini-Mental State Examination: β(SE) = 0.57(0.1), P ≤ 0.0001; and mPACC: β(SE) = 0.095(0.024), P ≤ 0.001] across the AD continuum. Interestingly, utilizing a ratio of the proteins that displayed higher levels in AD, such as SNAP-25 or 14-3-3 zeta/delta, over NPTX2 improved the biomarkers' associations with cognitive decline and brain atrophy. We found 14-3-3 zeta/delta and SNAP-25 to be especially promising as synaptic biomarkers of pathophysiological changes in AD. Neuronal pentraxins were identified as general indicators of neurodegeneration and associated with cognitive decline across various neurodegenerative dementias. Cognitive decline and brain atrophy were best predicted by ratios of SNAP-25/NPTX2 and 14-3-3 zeta/delta/NPTX2.	biomarkers; cognition; mass spectrometry; synaptic pathology

Comparison of immunoassay- with mass spectrometry-derived p-tau quantification for the detection of Alzheimer's disease pathology.	BACKGROUND: Antibody-based immunoassays have enabled quantification of very low concentrations of phosphorylated tau (p-tau) protein forms in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), aiding in the diagnosis of AD. Mass spectrometry enables absolute quantification of multiple p-tau variants within a single run. The goal of this study was to compare the performance of mass spectrometry assessments of p-tau METHODS: We measured p-tau RESULTS: Mass spectrometry and immunoassays of p-tau CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that while similar overall, immunoassay-based p-tau biomarkers are slightly superior to antibody-free mass spectrometry-based p-tau biomarkers. Future work is needed to determine whether the potential to evaluate multiple biomarkers within a single run offsets the slightly lower performance of antibody-free mass spectrometry-based p-tau quantification.

Plasma Biomarker Strategy for Selecting Patients With Alzheimer Disease for Antiamyloid Immunotherapies.	IMPORTANCE: Antiamyloid immunotherapies against Alzheimer disease (AD) are emerging. Scalable, cost-effective tools will be needed to identify amyloid β (Aβ)-positive patients without an advanced stage of tau pathology who are most likely to benefit from these therapies. Blood-based biomarkers might reduce the need to use cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or positron emission tomography (PET) for this. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate plasma biomarkers for identifying Aβ positivity and stage of tau accumulation. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The cohort study (BioFINDER-2) was a prospective memory-clinic and population-based study. Participants with cognitive concerns were recruited from 2017 to 2022 and divided into a training set (80% of the data) and test set (20%). EXPOSURE: Baseline values for plasma phosphorylated tau 181 (p-tau181), p-tau217, p-tau231, N-terminal tau, glial fibrillary acidic protein, and neurofilament light chain. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Performance to classify participants by Aβ status (defined by Aβ-PET or CSF Aβ42/40) and tau status (tau PET). Number of hypothetically saved PET scans in a plasma biomarker-guided workflow. RESULTS: Of a total 912 participants, there were 499 males (54.7%) and 413 females (45.3%), and the mean (SD) age was 71.1 (8.49) years. Among the biomarkers, plasma p-tau217 was most strongly associated with Aβ positivity (test-set area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC] = 0.94; 95% CI, 0.90-0.97). A 2-cut-point procedure was evaluated, where only participants with ambiguous plasma p-tau217 values (17.1% of the participants in the test set) underwent CSF or PET to assign definitive Aβ status. This procedure had an overall sensitivity of 0.94 (95% CI, 0.90-0.98) and a specificity of 0.86 (95% CI, 0.77-0.95). Next, plasma biomarkers were used to differentiate low-intermediate vs high tau-PET load among Aβ-positive participants. Plasma p-tau217 again performed best, with the test AUC = 0.92 (95% CI, 0.86-0.97), without significant improvement when adding any of the other plasma biomarkers. At a false-negative rate less than 10%, the use of plasma p-tau217 could avoid 56.9% of tau-PET scans needed to identify high tau PET among Aβ-positive participants. The results were validated in an independent cohort (n = 118). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study found that algorithms using plasma p-tau217 can accurately identify most Aβ-positive individuals, including those likely to have a high tau load who would require confirmatory tau-PET imaging. Plasma p-tau217 measurements may substantially reduce the number of invasive and costly confirmatory tests required to identify individuals who would likely benefit from antiamyloid therapies.

Interactions between vascular burden and amyloid-β pathology on trajectories of tau accumulation.	Cerebrovascular pathology often co-exists with Alzheimer's disease pathology and can contribute to Alzheimer's disease-related clinical progression. However, the degree to which vascular burden contributes to Alzheimer's disease pathological progression is still unclear. This study aimed to investigate interactions between vascular burden and amyloid-β pathology on both baseline tau tangle load and longitudinal tau accumulation. We included 1229 participants from the Swedish BioFINDER-2 Study, including cognitively unimpaired and impaired participants with and without biomarker-confirmed amyloid-β pathology. All underwent baseline tau-PET (18F-RO948), and a subset (n = 677) underwent longitudinal tau-PET after 2.5 ± 1.0 years. Tau-PET uptake was computed for a temporal meta-region-of-interest. We focused on four main vascular imaging features and risk factors: microbleeds; white matter lesion volume; stroke-related events (infarcts, lacunes and haemorrhages); and the Framingham Heart Study Cardiovascular Disease risk score. To validate our in vivo results, we examined 1610 autopsy cases from an Arizona-based neuropathology cohort on three main vascular pathological features: cerebral amyloid angiopathy; white matter rarefaction; and infarcts. For the in vivo cohort, primary analyses included age-, sex- and APOE ɛ4-corrected linear mixed models between tau-PET (outcome) and interactions between time, amyloid-β and each vascular feature (predictors). For the neuropathology cohort, age-, sex- and APOE ɛ4-corrected linear models between tau tangle density (outcome) and an interaction between plaque density and each vascular feature (predictors) were performed. In cognitively unimpaired individuals, we observed a significant interaction between microbleeds and amyloid-β pathology on greater baseline tau load (β = 0.68, P < 0.001) and longitudinal tau accumulation (β = 0.11, P < 0.001). For white matter lesion volume, we did not observe a significant independent interaction effect with amyloid-β on tau after accounting for microbleeds. In cognitively unimpaired individuals, we further found that stroke-related events showed a significant negative interaction with amyloid-β on longitudinal tau (β = -0.08, P < 0.001). In cognitively impaired individuals, there were no significant interaction effects between cerebrovascular and amyloid-β pathology at all. In the neuropathology dataset, the in vivo observed interaction effects between cerebral amyloid angiopathy and plaque density (β = 0.38, P < 0.001) and between infarcts and plaque density (β = -0.11, P = 0.005) on tau tangle density were replicated. To conclude, we demonstrated that cerebrovascular pathology-in the presence of amyloid-β pathology-modifies tau accumulation in early stages of Alzheimer's disease. More specifically, the co-occurrence of microbleeds and amyloid-β pathology was associated with greater accumulation of tau aggregates during early disease stages. This opens the possibility that interventions targeting microbleeds may attenuate the rate of tau accumulation in Alzheimer's disease.

Novel CSF tau biomarkers can be used for disease staging of sporadic Alzheimer's disease.	Biological staging of individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD) may improve diagnostic and prognostic work-up of dementia in clinical practice and the design of clinical trials. Here, we created a staging model using the Subtype and Stage Inference (SuStaIn) algorithm by evaluating cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid-β (Aβ) and tau biomarkers in 426 participants from BioFINDER-2, that represent the entire spectrum of AD. The model composition and main analyses were replicated in 222 participants from the Knight ADRC cohort. SuStaIn revealed in the two cohorts that the data was best explained by a single biomarker sequence (one subtype), and that five CSF biomarkers (ordered: Aβ42/40, tau phosphorylation occupancies at the residues 217 and 205 [pT217/T217 and pT205/T205], microtubule-binding region of tau containing the residue 243 [MTBR-tau243], and total tau) were sufficient to create an accurate disease staging model. Increasing CSF stages (0-5) were associated with increased abnormality in other AD-related biomarkers, such as Aβ- and tau-PET, and aligned with different phases of longitudinal biomarker changes consistent with current models of AD progression. Higher CSF stages at baseline were associated with higher hazard ratio of clinical decline. Our findings indicate that a common pathophysiologic molecular pathway develops across all AD patients, and that a single CSF collection is sufficient to reliably indicate the presence of both AD pathologies and the degree and stage of disease progression.

CSF MTBR-tau243 is a specific biomarker of tau tangle pathology in Alzheimer's disease.	Aggregated insoluble tau is one of two defining features of Alzheimer's disease. Because clinical symptoms are strongly correlated with tau aggregates, drug development and clinical diagnosis need cost-effective and accessible specific fluid biomarkers of tau aggregates; however, recent studies suggest that the fluid biomarkers currently available cannot specifically track tau aggregates. We show that the microtubule-binding region (MTBR) of tau containing the residue 243 (MTBR-tau243) is a new cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker specific for insoluble tau aggregates and compared it to multiple other phosphorylated tau measures (p-tau181, p-tau205, p-tau217 and p-tau231) in two independent cohorts (BioFINDER-2, n = 448; and Knight Alzheimer Disease Research Center, n = 219). MTBR-tau243 was most strongly associated with tau-positron emission tomography (PET) and cognition, whereas showing the lowest association with amyloid-PET. In combination with p-tau205, MTBR-tau243 explained most of the total variance in tau-PET burden (0.58 ≤ R

Comparison of Group-Level and Individualized Brain Regions for Measuring Change in Longitudinal Tau Positron Emission Tomography in Alzheimer Disease.	IMPORTANCE: Longitudinal tau positron emission tomography (PET) is a relevant outcome in clinical trials evaluating disease-modifying therapies in Alzheimer disease (AD). A key unanswered question is whether the use of participant-specific (individualized) regions of interest (ROIs) is superior to conventional approaches where the same ROI (group-level) is used for each participant. OBJECTIVE: To compare group- and participant-level ROIs in participants at different stages of the AD clinical continuum in terms of annual percentage change in tau-PET standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) and sample size requirements. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This was a longitudinal cohort study with consecutive participant enrollment between September 18, 2017, and November 15, 2021. Included in the analysis were participants with mild cognitive impairment and AD dementia from the prospective and longitudinal Swedish Biomarkers For Identifying Neurodegenerative Disorders Early and Reliably 2 (BioFINDER-2) study; in addition, a validation sample (the AVID 05e, Expedition-3, Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative [ADNI], and BioFINDER-1 study cohorts) was also included. EXPOSURES: Tau PET (BioFINDER-2, [18F]RO948; validation sample, [18F]flortaucipir), 7 group-level (5 data-driven stages, meta-temporal, whole brain), and 5 individualized ROIs. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Annual percentage change in tau-PET SUVR across ROIs. Sample size requirements in simulated clinical trials using tau PET as an outcome were also calculated. RESULTS: A total of 215 participants (mean [SD] age, 71.4 (7.5) years; 111 male [51.6%]) from the BioFINDER-2 study were included in this analysis: 97 amyloid-β (Aβ)-positive cognitively unimpaired (CU) individuals, 77 with Aβ-positive mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 41 with AD dementia. In the validation sample were 137 Aβ-positive CU participants, 144 with Aβ-positive MCI, and 125 with AD dementia. Mean (SD) follow-up time was 1.8 (0.3) years. Using group-level ROIs, the largest annual percentage increase in tau-PET SUVR in Aβ-positive CU individuals was seen in a composite ROI combining the entorhinal cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala (4.29%; 95% CI, 3.42%-5.16%). In individuals with Aβ-positive MCI, the greatest change was seen in the temporal cortical regions (5.82%; 95% CI, 4.67%-6.97%), whereas in those with AD dementia, the greatest change was seen in the parietal regions (5.22%; 95% CI, 3.95%-6.49%). Significantly higher estimates of annual percentage change were found using several of the participant-specific ROIs. Importantly, the simplest participant-specific approach, where change in tau PET was calculated in an ROI that best matched the participant's data-driven disease stage, performed best in all 3 subgroups. For the power analysis, sample size reductions for the participant-specific ROIs ranged from 15.94% (95% CI, 8.14%-23.74%) to 72.10% (95% CI, 67.10%-77.20%) compared with the best-performing group-level ROIs. Findings were replicated using [18F]flortaucipir. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Finding suggest that certain individualized ROIs carry an advantage over group-level ROIs for assessing longitudinal tau changes and increase the power to detect treatment effects in AD clinical trials using longitudinal tau PET as an outcome.

Associations of CSF PDGFRβ With Aging, Blood-Brain Barrier Damage, Neuroinflammation, and Alzheimer Disease Pathologic Changes.	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Injured pericytes in the neurovascular unit release platelet-derived growth factor β (PDGFRβ) into the CSF. However, it is not clear how pericyte injury contributes to Alzheimer disease (AD)-related changes and blood-brain barrier (BBB) damage. We aimed to test whether CSF PDGFRβ was associated with different AD-associated and age-associated pathologic changes leading to dementia. METHODS: PDGFRβ was measured in the CSF of 771 participants with cognitively unimpaired (CU, n = 408), mild cognitive impairment (MCI, n = 175), and dementia (n = 188) from the Swedish BioFINDER-2 cohort. We then checked association with β-amyloid (Aβ)-PET and tau-PET standardized uptake value ratio, RESULTS: The cohort had a mean age of 67 years (CU = 62.8, MCI = 69.9, dementia = 70.4), and 50.1% were male (CU = 46.6%, MCI = 53.7%, dementia = 54.3%). Higher CSF PDGFRβ concentrations were related to higher age ( DISCUSSION: In summary, pericyte damage, reflected by CSF PDGFRβ, may be involved in age-related BBB disruption together with neuroinflammation, but is not related to Alzheimer-related pathologic changes.

Age-related and amyloid-beta-independent tau deposition and its downstream effects.	Amyloid-β (Aβ) is hypothesized to facilitate the spread of tau pathology beyond the medial temporal lobe. However, there is evidence that, independently of Aβ, age-related tau pathology might be present outside of the medial temporal lobe. We therefore aimed to study age-related Aβ-independent tau deposition outside the medial temporal lobe in two large cohorts and to investigate potential downstream effects of this on cognition and structural measures. We included 545 cognitively unimpaired adults (40-92 years) from the BioFINDER-2 study (in vivo) and 639 (64-108 years) from the Rush Alzheimer's Disease Center cohorts (ex vivo). 18F-RO948- and 18F-flutemetamol-PET standardized uptake value ratios were calculated for regional tau and global/regional Aβ in vivo. Immunohistochemistry was used to estimate Aβ load and tangle density ex vivo. In vivo medial temporal lobe volumes (subiculum, cornu ammonis 1) and cortical thickness (entorhinal cortex, Brodmann area 35) were obtained using Automated Segmentation for Hippocampal Subfields packages. Thickness of early and late neocortical Alzheimer's disease regions was determined using FreeSurfer. Global cognition and episodic memory were estimated to quantify cognitive functioning. In vivo age-related tau deposition was observed in the medial temporal lobe and in frontal and parietal cortical regions, which was statistically significant when adjusting for Aβ. This was also observed in individuals with low Aβ load. Tau deposition was negatively associated with cortical volumes and thickness in temporal and parietal regions independently of Aβ. The associations between age and cortical volume or thickness were partially mediated via tau in regions with early Alzheimer's disease pathology, i.e. early tau and/or Aβ pathology (subiculum/Brodmann area 35/precuneus/posterior cingulate). Finally, the associations between age and cognition were partially mediated via tau in Brodmann area 35, even when including Aβ-PET as covariate. Results were validated in the ex vivo cohort showing age-related and Aβ-independent increases in tau aggregates in and outside the medial temporal lobe. Ex vivo age-cognition associations were mediated by medial and inferior temporal tau tangle density, while correcting for Aβ density. Taken together, our study provides support for primary age-related tauopathy even outside the medial temporal lobe in vivo and ex vivo, with downstream effects on structure and cognition. These results have implications for our understanding of the spreading of tau outside the medial temporal lobe, also in the context of Alzheimer's disease. Moreover, this study suggests the potential utility of tau-targeting treatments in primary age-related tauopathy, likely already in preclinical stages in individuals with low Aβ pathology.

INTRODUCTION: Biomarkers for the prediction of cognitive decline in patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and amnestic mild dementia are needed for both clinical practice and clinical trials. METHODS: We evaluated the ability of tau-PET (positron emission tomography), cortical atrophy on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), baseline cognition, apolipoprotein E gene (APOE) status, plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of phosphorylated tau-217, neurofilament light (NfL), and amyloid beta (Aβ) RESULTS: Baseline tau-PET and a composite baseline cognitive score were the strongest independent predictors of cognitive decline. Cortical thickness and NfL provided some additional information. Using a predictive algorithm to enrich patient selection in a theoretical clinical trial led to a significantly lower required sample size. DISCUSSION: Models including baseline tau-PET and cognition consistently provided the best prediction of change in cognitive function over 2 years in patients with amnestic MCI or mild dementia.

Confounding factors of Alzheimer's disease plasma biomarkers and their impact on clinical performance.	INTRODUCTION: Plasma biomarkers will likely revolutionize the diagnostic work-up of Alzheimer's disease (AD) globally. Before widespread use, we need to determine if confounding factors affect the levels of these biomarkers, and their clinical utility. METHODS: Participants with plasma and CSF biomarkers, creatinine, body mass index (BMI), and medical history data were included (BioFINDER-1: n = 748, BioFINDER-2: n = 421). We measured beta-amyloid (Aβ42, Aβ40), phosphorylated tau (p-tau217, p-tau181), neurofilament light (NfL), and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). RESULTS: In both cohorts, creatinine and BMI were the main factors associated with NfL, GFAP, and to a lesser extent with p-tau. However, adjustment for BMI and creatinine had only minor effects in models predicting either the corresponding levels in CSF or subsequent development of dementia. DISCUSSION: Creatinine and BMI are related to certain plasma biomarkers levels, but they do not have clinically relevant confounding effects for the vast majority of individuals. HIGHLIGHTS: Creatinine and body mass index (BMI) are related to certain plasma biomarker levels. Adjusting for creatinine and BMI has minor influence on plasma-cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) associations. Adjusting for creatinine and BMI has minor influence on prediction of dementia using plasma biomarkers.	amyloid; cerebrospinal fluid; dementia; glial fibrillary acidic protein; neurofilament light; p-tau

Measures of cortical microstructure are linked to amyloid pathology in Alzheimer's disease.	Markers of downstream events are a key component of clinical trials of disease-modifying therapies for Alzheimer's disease. Morphological metrics like cortical thickness are established measures of atrophy but are not sensitive enough to detect amyloid-beta (Aβ)- related changes that occur before overt atrophy become visible. We aimed to investigate to what extent diffusion MRI can provide sensitive markers of cortical microstructural changes and to test their associations with multiple aspects of the Alzheimer's disease pathological cascade, including both Aβ and tau accumulation, astrocytic activation and cognitive deficits. We applied the mean apparent diffusion propagator model to diffusion MRI data from 492 cognitively unimpaired elderly and patients with mild cognitive impairment from the Swedish BioFINDER-2 cohort. Participants were stratified in Aβ-negative/tau-negative, Aβ-positive/tau-negative and Aβ-positive/tau-positive based on Aβ- and tau-PET uptake. Cortical regional values of diffusion MRI metrics and cortical thickness were compared across groups. Associations between regional values of diffusion MRI metrics and both Aβ- and tau-PET uptake were also investigated along with the association with plasma level of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), a marker of astrocyte activation (available in 292 participants). Mean squared displacement revealed widespread microstructural differences already between Aβ-negative/tau-negative and Aβ-positive/tau-negative participants with a spatial distribution that closely resembled the pattern of Aβ accumulation. In contrast, differences in cortical thickness were clearly more limited. Mean squared displacement was also correlated with both Aβ- and tau-PET uptake even independently from one another and from cortical thickness. Further, the same metric exhibited significantly stronger correlations with PET uptake than cortical thickness (P < 0.05). Mean squared displacement was also positively correlated with GFAP with a pattern that resembles Aβ accumulation, and GFAP partially mediated the association between Aβ accumulation and mean squared displacement. Further, impairments in executive functions were significantly more associated with mean squared displacement values extracted from a meta-region of interest encompassing regions accumulating Aβ early in the disease process, than with cortical thickness (P < 0.05). Similarly, impairments in memory functions were significantly more associated with mean squared displacement values extracted from a temporal meta-region of interest than with cortical thickness (P < 0.05). Metrics of cortical microstructural alteration derived from diffusion MRI are highly sensitive to multiple aspects of the Alzheimer's disease pathological cascade. Of particular interest is the link with both Aβ-PET and GFAP, suggesting diffusion MRI might reflects microstructural changes related to the astrocytic response to Aβ aggregation. Therefore, metrics of cortical diffusion might be important outcome measures in anti-Aβ treatments clinical trials for detecting drug-induced changes in cortical microstructure.

Phospho-tau with subthreshold tau-PET predicts increased tau accumulation rates in amyloid-positive individuals.	Different tau biomarkers become abnormal at different stages of Alzheimer's disease, with CSF phospho-tau typically becoming elevated at subthreshold levels of tau-PET binding. To capitalize on the temporal order of tau biomarker-abnormality and capture the earliest changes of tau accumulation, we implemented an observational study design to examine longitudinal changes in tau-PET, cortical thickness and cognitive decline in amyloid-β-positive individuals with elevated CSF p-tau levels (P+) but subthreshold Tau-PET retention (T-). To this end, individuals without dementia (i.e. cognitively unimpaired or mild cognitive impairment, n = 231) were selected from the BioFINDER-2 study. Amyloid-β-positive (A+) individuals were categorized into biomarker groups based on cut-offs for abnormal CSF p-tau217 and 18F-RO948 (Tau) PET, yielding groups of tau-concordant-negative (A+P-T-; n = 30), tau-discordant (i.e. A+P+T-; n = 48) and tau-concordant-positive (A+P+T+; n = 18) individuals. In addition, 135 amyloid-β-negative, tau-negative, cognitively unimpaired individuals served as controls. Differences in annual change in regional tau-PET, cortical thickness and cognition between the groups were assessed using general linear models, adjusted for age, sex, clinical diagnosis and (for cognitive measures only) education. Mean follow-up time was ∼2 years. Longitudinal increase in tau-PET was faster in the A+P+T- group than in the control and A+P-T- groups across medial temporal and neocortical regions, with the highest accumulation rates in the medial temporal lobe. The A+P+T- group showed a slower rate of increase in tau-PET compared to the A+P+T+ group, primarily in neocortical regions. We did not detect differences in yearly change in cortical thickness or in cognitive decline between the A+P+T- and A+P-T- groups. The A+P+T+ group, however, showed faster cognitive decline compared to all other groups. Altogether, these findings suggest that the A+P+T- biomarker profile in persons without dementia is associated with an isolated effect on increased tau-PET accumulation rates but not on cortical thinning and cognitive decline. While this suggests that the tau-discordant biomarker profile is not strongly associated with short-term clinical decline, this group does represent an interesting population for monitoring the effects of interventions with disease-modifying agents on tau accumulation in early Alzheimer's disease, and for examining the emergence of tau aggregates in Alzheimer's disease. Further, we suggest updating the AT(N) criteria for Alzheimer's disease biomarker classification to APT(N).	Alzheimer; CSF; PET; discordance; tau

A genetic and transcriptomic assessment of the KTN1 gene in Parkinson's disease risk.	Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurological disorder caused by both genetic and environmental factors. An association has been described between KTN1 genetic variants and changes in its expression in the putamen and substantia nigra brain regions and an increased risk for PD. Here, we examine the link between PD susceptibility and KTN1 using individual-level genotyping data and summary statistics from the most recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for PD risk and age at onset from the International Parkinson's Disease Genomics Consortium (IPDGC), as well as whole-genome sequencing data from the Accelerating Medicines Partnership Parkinson's disease (AMP-PD) initiative. To investigate the potential effect of changes in KTN1 expression on PD compared to unaffected individuals, we further assess publicly available expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) results from GTEx v8 and BRAINEAC and transcriptomics data from AMP-PD. Overall, we found no genetic associations between KTN1 and PD in our cohorts but found potential evidence of differences in mRNA expression, which needs to be further explored.

The utilization of artificial intelligence in studying the dysregulation of gene expression in Alzheimer's disease (AD) affected brain tissues remains underexplored, particularly in delineating common and specific transcriptomic signatures across different brain regions implicated in AD-related cellular and molecular processes, which could help illuminate novel disease biology for biomarker and target discovery. Herein we developed a deep learning framework, which consisted of multi-layer perceptron (MLP) models to classify neuropathologically confirmed AD versus controls, using bulk tissue RNA-seq data from the RNAseq Harmonization Study of the Accelerating Medicines Project for Alzheimer's Disease (AMP-AD) consortium. The models were trained based on data from three distinct brain regions, including dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), and head of the caudate nucleus (HCN), obtained from the Religious Orders Study/Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP). Subsequently, we inferred a disease progression trajectory for each brain region by applying unsupervised dimensionality transformation to the distribution of the subjects' expression profiles. To interpret the MLP models, we employed an interpretable method for deep neural network models, obtaining SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values and identified the most significantly AD-implicated genes for gene co-expression network analysis. Our models demonstrated robust performance in classification and prediction across two other external datasets from the Mayo RNA-seq (MAYO) cohort and the Mount Sinai Brain Bank (MSBB) cohort of AMP-AD. By interpreting the models both mechanistically and biologically, our study elucidated subtle molecular alterations in various brain regions, uncovering shared transcriptomic signatures activated in microglia and sex-specific modules in neurons relevant to AD. Notably, we identified, for the first time, a sex-linked transcription factor pair (ZFX/ZFY) associated with more pronounced neuronal loss in AD females, shedding light on a novel mechanism for sex dimorphism in AD. This study lays the groundwork for leveraging artificial intelligence methodologies to investigate AD at the molecular level, which is not readily achievable from conventional analysis approaches such as differential gene expression (DGE) analysis. The transcription factor implicated in sex difference also underpins a new molecular mechanistic basis of women's greater neurodegeneration in AD warranting further study.

Heparin-enriched plasma proteome is significantly altered in Alzheimer's disease.	INTRODUCTION: Heparin binding proteins (HBPs) with roles in extracellular matrix assembly are strongly correlated to β-amyloid (Aβ) and tau pathology in Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). However, it remains challenging to detect these proteins in plasma using standard mass spectrometry-based proteomic approaches. METHODS: We employed heparin-affinity chromatography, followed by off-line fractionation and tandem mass tag mass spectrometry (TMT-MS), to enrich HBPs from plasma obtained from AD (n = 62) and control (n = 47) samples. These profiles were then correlated to Aβ, tau and phosphorylated tau (pTau) CSF biomarkers and plasma pTau181 from the same individuals, as well as a consensus brain proteome network to assess the overlap with AD brain pathophysiology. RESULTS: Heparin enrichment from plasma was highly reproducible, enriched well-known HBPs like APOE and thrombin, and depleted high-abundant proteins such as albumin. A total of 2865 proteins, spanning 10 orders of magnitude in abundance, were measured across 109 samples. Compared to the consensus AD brain protein co-expression network, we observed that specific plasma proteins exhibited consistent direction of change in both brain and plasma, whereas others displayed divergent changes, highlighting the complex interplay between the two compartments. Elevated proteins in AD plasma, when compared to controls, included members of the matrisome module in brain that accumulate with Aβ deposits, such as SMOC1, SMOC2, SPON1, MDK, OLFML3, FRZB, GPNMB, and the APOE4 proteoform. Additionally, heparin-enriched proteins in plasma demonstrated significant correlations with conventional AD CSF biomarkers, including Aβ, total tau, pTau, and plasma pTau181. A panel of five plasma proteins classified AD from control individuals with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.85. When combined with plasma pTau181, the panel significantly improved the classification performance of pTau181 alone, increasing the AUC from 0.93 to 0.98. This suggests that the heparin-enriched plasma proteome captures additional variance in cognitive dementia beyond what is explained by pTau181. CONCLUSION: These findings support the utility of a heparin-affinity approach coupled with TMT-MS for enriching amyloid-associated proteins, as well as a wide spectrum of plasma biomarkers that reflect pathological changes in the AD brain.

Nomination of a novel plasma protein biomarker panel capable of classifying Alzheimer's disease dementia with high accuracy in an African American cohort.	INTRODUCTION: African Americans (AA) are widely underrepresented in plasma biomarker studies for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and current diagnostic biomarker candidates do not reflect the heterogeneity of AD. METHODS: Untargeted proteome measurements were obtained using the SomaScan 7k platform to identify novel plasma biomarkers for AD in a cohort of AA clinically diagnosed as AD dementia (n=183) or cognitively unimpaired (CU, n=145). Machine learning approaches were implemented to identify the set of plasma proteins that yields the best classification accuracy. RESULTS: A plasma protein panel achieved an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.91 to classify AD dementia vs CU. The reproducibility of this finding was observed in the ANMerge plasma and AMP-AD Diversity brain datasets (AUC=0.83; AUC=0.94). DISCUSSION: This study demonstrates the potential of biomarker discovery through untargeted plasma proteomics and machine learning approaches. Our findings also highlight the potential importance of the matrisome and cerebrovascular dysfunction in AD pathophysiology.

Increased Incidence of Epilepsy in a Brain Bank Alzheimer's Disease Cohort and Its Association With TDP-43 Pathology.	AIMS: Evidence suggests Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients are at increased risk of epilepsy and that seizure incidence is associated with faster cognitive decline. Previous studies indicate hyperphosphorylated tau may play a role in this disease association; however, abnormal TDP-43 and α-synuclein deposition have not been extensively examined. METHODS: Clinical and neuropathological records of AD cases over a 5-year period were retrieved from the London Neurodegenerative Diseases Brain Bank. The 114 cases were categorised into three groups: AD plus epilepsy, AD plus hippocampal sclerosis (HS) and AD only. Semi-quantitative scores for tau, TDP-43 and α-synuclein pathology within the middle temporal gyrus, hippocampus and amygdala were compared between groups. RESULTS: A 12% incidence of epilepsy and/or epileptic symptomology was found among the cohort. Twelve cases (11%) showed HS. No significant difference in tau pathology scores was seen between groups. However, a significantly higher score for TDP-43 was seen in AD plus epilepsy compared with AD only in the middle temporal gyrus (p = 0.004). The burden of α-synuclein pathology was increased in the amygdala of AD plus epilepsy and AD plus HS. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of epilepsy within this AD cohort is higher than expected within the general population (even when matched for age), and this may be associated with increased TDP-43 burden. Understanding the relationship between AD and epilepsy may highlight mechanisms of cellular damage and tissue vulnerability.	Alzheimer's disease; TDP‐43; epilepsy; hippocampal sclerosis; seizures

Aging is the strongest risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD), yet the molecular mechanisms linking aging to AD remain poorly understood. DNA methylation (DNAm) is an epigenetic modification that plays a critical role in gene regulation and has been implicated in both aging and AD. In this study, we performed a meta-analysis of DNAm profiles in the prefrontal cortex using two large, independent postmortem brain cohorts, the Religious Orders Study and Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP) and Brains for Dementia Research (BDR), to identify DNAm differences associated with aging in late life. We identified 3,264 CpGs significantly associated with aging, the majority of which were hypermethylated and enriched in promoter regions and CpG islands. These aging-associated DNAm changes were significantly overrepresented in genes involved in immune regulation and metabolic pathways. When compared with AD-associated DNAm changes, we found a significant overlap, with nearly all CpGs and differentially methylated regions (DMRs) that were associated with both aging and AD Braak stage displaying concordant directionality. This supports the hypothesis that aging and AD are interconnected at the molecular level. Further integrative analyses indicated that a number of these DNAm variants may have functional relevance in AD. By integrating blood DNAm data, we identified multiple CpGs that showed significant brain-to-blood correlations and were involved in both aging and AD pathogenesis. Co-localization analyses with genome-wide association study (GWAS) data revealed shared genetic regulation of DNAm and dementia at several AD risk loci. Out-of-sample validation using the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset demonstrated that, among 334 CpGs showing concordant DNAm changes in aging and AD, baseline DNAm levels at cg10752406 in the	Aging; Alzheimer’s disease; DNA methylation; biomarkers; epigenetics

Comparative studies of hair shaft components between healthy and diseased donors.	Globally, the rapid aging of the population is predicted to become even more severe in the second half of the 21st century. Thus, it is expected to establish a growing expectation for innovative, non-invasive health indicators and diagnostic methods to support disease prevention, care, and health promotion efforts. In this study, we aimed to establish a new health index and disease diagnosis method by analyzing the minerals and free amino acid components contained in hair shaft. We first evaluated the range of these components in healthy humans and then conducted a comparative analysis of these components in subjects with diabetes, hypertension, androgenetic alopecia, major depressive disorder, Alzheimer's disease, and stroke. In the statistical analysis, we first used a student's t test to compare the hair components of healthy people and those of patients with various diseases. However, many minerals and free amino acids showed significant differences in all diseases, because the sample size of the healthy group was very large compared to the sample size of the disease group. Therefore, we attempted a comparative analysis based on effect size, which is not affected by differences in sample size. As a result, we were able to narrow down the minerals and free amino acids for all diseases compared to t test analysis. For diabetes, the t test narrowed down the minerals to 15, whereas the effect size measurement narrowed it down to 3 (Cr, Mn, and Hg). For free amino acids, the t test narrowed it down to 15 minerals. By measuring the effect size, we were able to narrow it down to 7 (Gly, His, Lys, Pro, Ser, Thr, and Val). It is also possible to narrow down the minerals and free amino acids in other diseases, and to identify potential health indicators and disease-related components by using effect size.

Is later-life depression a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease or a prodromal symptom: a study using post-mortem human brain tissue?	BACKGROUND: Depression and dementia are both common diseases. Although new cases of depression are more common in younger adults, there is a second peak at the age of 50 years suggesting a different pathological process. Late-life depression (LLD) is associated with dementia. However, it remains unclear whether depression represents a dementia prodrome or is a true risk factor for its development. LLD is thought to have a vascular component and this may be a possible link between depression and dementia. We hypothesised that later-life depression is a prodromal manifestation of dementia and would therefore be associated with more AD, and/or ischaemic brain abnormalities that are present in earlier-life depression or in age- and sex-matched controls. METHODS: We assessed post-mortem orbitofrontal cortex and dorsolateral pre-frontal cortex from 145 individuals in 4 groups: 28 18-50-year-olds with depression, 30 older individuals (ages 51-90) with depression, 28 with early AD (Braak tangle stages III-IV) and 57 matched controls (17 early-life, 42 later-life). Levels of Aβ, phospho-tau and α-synuclein were assessed by immunohistochemistry and ELISA. To quantify chronic ischaemia, VEGF, MAG and PLP1 were measured by ELISA. To assess pericyte damage, PDGFRB was measured by ELISA. For blood-brain barrier leakiness, JAM-A, claudin 5 and fibrinogen were measured by ELISA. To quantity endothelial activation, the ratio of ICAM1:collagen IV was assessed by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: There was no evidence of chronic cerebral hypoperfusion or increased Aβ/tau in either depression group. There was also no indication of pericyte damage, increased blood-brain barrier leakiness or endothelial activation in the OFC or DLPFC in the depression groups. CONCLUSIONS: Contrary to some previous findings, we have not found evidence of impaired vascular function or increased Aβ in LLD. Our study had a relatively small sample size and limitations in the availability of clinical data. These results suggest that depression is a risk factor for dementia rather than an early manifestation of AD or a consequence of cerebral vascular insufficiency.

Age-related hearing loss and dementia-related neuropathology: An analysis of the United Kingdom brains for dementia research cohort.	Age-related hearing loss frequently precedes or coexists with mild cognitive impairment and dementia. The role specific neuropathologies play in this association, as either a cause or a consequence, is unclear. We therefore aimed to investigate whether specific dementia related neuropathologies were associated with hearing impairment in later life. We analysed data on ante-mortem hearing impairment with post-mortem neuropathological data for 442 participants from the Brains for Dementia Research Cohort. Binary logistic regression models were used to estimate the association of hearing impairment with the presence of each dementia-related neuropathology overall, and with specific staged changes. All analyses adjusted for age and sex, and several sensitivity analyses were conducted to test the robustness of findings. Presence and density of neuritic plaques were associated with higher odds of hearing impairment ante-mortem (OR = 3.65, 95% CI 1.78-7.46 for frequent density of plaques). Presence of any LB disease was likewise associated with hearing impairment (OR = 2.10, 95% CI 1.27-3.48), but this did not increase with higher cortical pathology (OR = 1.53, 95% CI 0.75-3.11). Nonspecific amyloid deposition, neurofibrillary tangle staging, overall AD neuropathology level, and cerebrovascular disease were not clearly associated with increased risks of hearing impairment. Our results provide some support for an association between dementia-related neuropathology and hearing loss and suggest that hearing loss may be associated with a high neuritic plaque burden and more common in Lewy body disease.	cognitive; dementia; hearing; impairment; loss; neuropathology

Sex Differences in Dementia, Cognition, and Health in the Cognitive Function and Ageing Studies (CFAS).	BACKGROUND: There is renewed interest in whether sex differences in dementia risk exist, and what influence social and biological factors have. OBJECTIVE: To review evidence from the Cognitive Function and Ageing Studies (CFAS), a multi-center population-representative cohort study in the UK; focusing on dementia and cognition, incorporating findings on participants' health and social circumstances. METHODS: After identifying all CFAS publications, the results of all sex-stratified primary analyses of CFAS data were narratively reviewed. RESULTS: Of 337 publications, 94 report results by sex (including null findings), which are summarized by theme: dementia epidemiology, cognition, mental health, health expectancy, social context and biological resource (including neuropathology). CONCLUSIONS: Where differences are found they most commonly favor men; however, greater mortality in men may confound associations with age-related outcomes. This 'survival bias' may explain findings of greater risk of dementia and faster cognitive decline in women. Age-specific dementia incidence was similar between sexes, although reduced incidence across study generations was more pronounced in men. Mood disorders were more prevalent in women, but adjusting for disability and deprivation attenuated the association. Prominent findings from other cohorts that women have more Alzheimer's disease pathology and greater risk of dementia from the Apolipoprotein E ɛ4 allele were not observed, warranting further investigation. The 'male-female health-survival paradox' is demonstrated whereby women live longer but with more comorbidity and disability. Examining why health expectancies changed differently over two decades for each sex (interacting with deprivation) may inform population interventions to improve cognitive, mental and physical health in later life.

Ranking and filtering of neuropathology features in the machine learning evaluation of dementia studies.	Early diagnosis of dementia diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, is difficult because of the time and resources needed to perform neuropsychological and pathological assessments. Given the increasing use of machine learning methods to evaluate neuropathology features in the brains of dementia patients, it is important to investigate how the selection of features may be impacted and which features are most important for the classification of dementia. We objectively assessed neuropathology features using machine learning techniques for filtering features in two independent ageing cohorts, the Cognitive Function and Aging Studies (CFAS) and Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). The reliefF and least loss methods were most consistent with their rankings between ADNI and CFAS; however, reliefF was most biassed by feature-feature correlations. Braak stage was consistently the highest ranked feature and its ranking was not correlated with other features, highlighting its unique importance. Using a smaller set of highly ranked features, rather than all features, can achieve a similar or better dementia classification performance in CFAS (60%-70% accuracy with Naïve Bayes). This study showed that specific neuropathology features can be prioritised by feature filtering methods, but they are impacted by feature-feature correlations and their results can vary between cohort studies. By understanding these biases, we can reduce discrepancies in feature ranking and identify a minimal set of features needed for accurate classification of dementia.

Relationships of brain cholesterol and cholesterol biosynthetic enzymes to Alzheimer's pathology and dementia in the CFAS population-derived neuropathology cohort.	Altered cholesterol metabolism is implicated in brain ageing and Alzheimer's disease. We examined whether key genes regulating cholesterol metabolism and levels of brain cholesterol are altered in dementia and Alzheimer's disease neuropathological change (ADNC). Temporal cortex (n = 99) was obtained from the Cognitive Function and Ageing Study. Expression of the cholesterol biosynthesis rate-limiting enzyme HMG-CoA reductase (HMGCR) and its regulator, SREBP2, were detected using immunohistochemistry. Expression of HMGCR, SREBP2, CYP46A1 and ABCA1 were quantified by qPCR in samples enriched for astrocyte and neuronal RNA following laser-capture microdissection. Total cortical cholesterol was measured using the Amplex Red assay. HMGCR and SREBP2 proteins were predominantly expressed in pyramidal neurones, and in glia. Neuronal HMGCR did not vary with ADNC, oxidative stress, neuroinflammation or dementia status. Expression of HMGCR neuronal mRNA decreased with ADNC (p = 0.022) and increased with neuronal DNA damage (p = 0.049), whilst SREBP2 increased with ADNC (p = 0.005). High or moderate tertiles for cholesterol levels were associated with increased dementia risk (OR 1.44, 1.58). APOE ε4 allele was not associated with cortical cholesterol levels. ADNC is associated with gene expression changes that may impair cholesterol biosynthesis in neurones but not astrocytes, whilst levels of cortical cholesterol show a weak relationship to dementia status.

Insights into the pathological basis of dementia from population-based neuropathology studies.	The epidemiological neuropathology perspective of population and community-based studies allows unbiased assessment of the prevalence of various pathologies and their relationships to late-life dementia. In addition, this approach provides complementary insights to conventional case-control studies, which tend to be more representative of a younger clinical cohort. The Cognitive Function and Ageing Study (CFAS) is a longitudinal study of cognitive impairment and frailty in the general United Kingdom population. In this review, we provide an overview of the major findings from CFAS, alongside other studies, which have demonstrated a high prevalence of pathology in the ageing brain, particularly Alzheimer's disease neuropathological change and vascular pathology. Increasing burdens of these pathologies are the major correlates of dementia, especially neurofibrillary tangles, but there is substantial overlap in pathology between those with and without dementia, particularly at intermediate burdens of pathology and also at the oldest ages. Furthermore, additional pathologies such as limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy, ageing-related tau astrogliopathy and primary age-related tauopathies contribute to late-life dementia. Findings from ageing population-representative studies have implications for the understanding of dementia pathology in the community. The high prevalence of pathology and variable relationship to dementia status has implications for disease definition and indicate a role for modulating factors on cognitive outcome. The complexity of late-life dementia, with mixed pathologies, indicates a need for a better understanding of these processes across the life-course to direct the best research for reducing risk in later life of avoidable clinical dementia syndromes.

Assessment of Alzheimer-related pathologies of dementia using machine learning feature selection.	Although a variety of brain lesions may contribute to the pathological assessment of dementia, the relationship of these lesions to dementia, how they interact and how to quantify them remains uncertain. Systematically assessing neuropathological measures by their degree of association with dementia may lead to better diagnostic systems and treatment targets. This study aims to apply machine learning approaches to feature selection in order to identify critical features of Alzheimer-related pathologies associated with dementia. We applied machine learning techniques for feature ranking and classification to objectively compare neuropathological features and their relationship to dementia status during life using a cohort (n=186) from the Cognitive Function and Ageing Study (CFAS). We first tested Alzheimer's Disease and tau markers and then other neuropathologies associated with dementia. Seven feature ranking methods using different information criteria consistently ranked 22 out of the 34 neuropathology features for importance to dementia classification. Although highly correlated, Braak neurofibrillary tangle stage, beta-amyloid and cerebral amyloid angiopathy features were ranked the highest. The best-performing dementia classifier using the top eight neuropathological features achieved 79% sensitivity, 69% specificity and 75% precision. However, when assessing all seven classifiers and the 22 ranked features, a substantial proportion (40.4%) of dementia cases was consistently misclassified. These results highlight the benefits of using machine learning to identify critical indices of plaque, tangle and cerebral amyloid angiopathy burdens that may be useful for classifying dementia.

Do Glioma Cells Rewire Neural Circuits through Epigenetic Changes? DNA Methylation Analysis of Genes Involved in Neuron-Glioma Communication in the Human Frontal Cortex.	Gliomas are known to form connections with nearby neurons, which help drive their own growth. What is less clear is how these tumor cells adapt at the molecular level to join neural circuits. We investigated whether changes in DNA methylation might play a role, focusing on genes that support communication between neurons and glial cells. We analyzed DNA methylation in 302 glioma samples from the frontal lobe and compared them to 261 control brain samples, via the Illumina 450K array. From these data, we focused on 70 genes involved in astrocyte-neuron signaling. Our analysis was adjusted for age, sex, race, and cell-type composition. We applied multiple testing correction (FDR < 0.01) and performed enrichment analysis on significant sites. We identified 528 CpG sites with significant differences in methylation. Approximately 77% of these genes were hypomethylated in glioma. Several of the most affected genes, CACNA1C, KCNMA1, SYT7, and GABBR2, are important for ion flow, neurotransmission, and synaptic structure. Interestingly, several of these genes show reduced expression in previous studies despite being hypomethylated, indicating the involvement of additional regulatory mechanisms. Functional analysis revealed links to apoptosis, synaptic signaling, and remodeling of the extracellular matrix. Glioma cells appear to shift their epigenetic landscape in ways that support a more neuron-like identity. This may help them integrate into brain circuits. These findings highlight genes and pathways that could serve as potential biomarkers or treatment targets at the interface between tumors and the nervous system.

Ethical, legal, and sociocultural considerations in neural device explantation: a systematic review.	INTRODUCTION: Implantable neural devices, including brain-computer interfaces and spinal cord stimulators, hold significant therapeutic promise for conditions such as paralysis and chronic pain. However, the novelty of these technologies introduces unique ethical challenges. While much of the existing literature emphasizes development-related concerns such as device safety, the ethical issues surrounding explantation remain relatively underexplored. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review to identify ethical, legal, and sociocultural considerations relevant to the explantation of neural devices. The review applied the IEEE BRAIN Neuroethics framework as a guiding structure for the categorization of the themes. A subsequent thematic analysis was performed to categorize and synthesize findings across studies. RESULTS: Thematic analysis revealed that medical motives were the predominant factor in discussions of explantation, with 83% of studies citing medical complications as a central concern. Additional themes identified included changes in cognition and behavior, emotional well-being, lack of therapeutic benefit, identity, financial issues, autonomy, post-trial considerations, and neurorights. DISCUSSION: Our findings underscore the multifaceted nature of neural device explantation, extending beyond purely medical considerations to include psychological, financial, legal, and sociocultural dimensions. These results highlight the necessity of interdisciplinary approaches to adequately address the broad spectrum of challenges associated with explantation.	brain-computer interfaces; clinical trial; ethics; explantation; neural implants; neurodevices; research ethics

Harmonized Cognitive Assessment Protocol (HCAP): What Makes an HCAP an HCAP? An Adaptive Architecture for Measuring Cognitive Aging Around the World.	OBJECTIVES: Harmonized cognitive batteries are crucial for studying cognitive impairment and dementia in aging populations globally. Challenges persist in administering them in a way that maintains both cross-national comparability and local validity to measure cognitive functioning across settings. In this perspective, we review the approach undertaken in the Harmonized Cognitive Assessment Protocol (HCAP) network of studies and propose that the core identity of the HCAP lies not in a fixed set of tests but in a fixed-flexible, cross-culturally adaptive measurement architecture. METHODS: Via expert engagement, we examined the evolving goals of HCAP studies, delineated necessary study settings, and outlined domain-specific recommendations for cognitive assessments. RESULTS: To balance high-quality measurement of cognitive domains and maintain the ability to perform meaningful cross-national comparisons, each HCAP should include a common set of at least three to four continuously distributed test items per domain that can link domains across studies. We present candidate tests and offer recommendations for domains of memory, executive functioning, language, visuospatial ability, and orientation. We discuss considerations for HCAP studies regarding appropriate sampling, test battery length of at least one hour, interviewer training, and missing data handling. DISCUSSION: We advocate for the HCAP as a structured yet adaptable framework that prioritizes measurement precision and cultural relevance, while retaining sufficient uniformity to conduct statistical harmonization across settings. What makes an HCAP an HCAP is not a strict checklist of tests, but a commitment to rigorous, culturally respectful measurement of cognitive health in older adults around the world.	cognition; cross-national comparisons; culture; harmonization; neuropsychology

Organ-Specific Dedifferentiation and Epigenetic Remodeling in In Vivo Reprogramming.	The advent of in vivo reprogramming through transient expression of the Yamanaka factors (OCT4, SOX2, KLF4, and c-MYC) holds strong promise for regenerative medicine, despite ongoing concerns about safety and clinical applicability. This review synthesizes recent advances in in vivo reprogramming, focusing on its potential to restore regenerative competence and promote rejuvenation across diverse tissues, including the retina, skeletal muscle, heart, liver, brain, and intestine. We highlight mechanistic parallels and distinctions between injury-induced dedifferentiation and OSKM-mediated reprogramming, emphasizing the roles of dedifferentiation, transient regenerative progenitors, and epigenetic remodeling. Critical safety considerations-such as teratoma formation, organ failure, and loss of cell identity-are discussed alongside strategies designed to mitigate these risks, like cyclic induction and targeted delivery. Finally, we briefly note the growing translational interest in this field, alongside directing readers to recent reviews for detailed coverage of biotech initiatives. Collectively, this work underscores the transformative potential of in vivo reprogramming for both tissue regeneration and rejuvenation, while stressing the importance of precise spatiotemporal control for its safe clinical application.

Environmental toxicants and Parkinson's disease: recent evidence, risks, and prevention opportunities.	The global burden of Parkinson's disease is rising. Large-scale genetic studies have confirmed that extrinsic or environmental factors, rather than genetic predisposition, play a dominant role in its cause. Increasing evidence implicates three classes of toxicants-certain pesticides, the dry-cleaning chemicals trichloroethylene and perchloroethylene, and air pollution-in the development of Parkinson's disease. These toxicants are widely prevalent, impair mitochondrial or lysosomal function, or both, and contribute to, if not cause, the disease. Parkinson's disease could be thus largely preventable. Uncertainties remain regarding the relevant doses, timing, and routes of exposure, the nature of genetic and environmental interactions, the effects of combined exposures, the role of the microbiome, and the identity of other environmental risks. Methodological limitations and structural challenges hinder our understanding. However, improved measurement of toxicant exposure in individuals and the environment, long-term prospective studies, increased funding for prevention, and policy changes can precipitate the fall of the burden of Parkinson's disease.

Workplace bullying and professional identity among male nurses: the mediating role of work engagement and the moderating effect of fear of negative evaluation.	OBJECTIVE: Workplace bullying poses a critical occupational hazard in nursing. The gender and relative scarcity of male nurses heighten their vulnerability to bullying, triggering burnout and eroding their professional identity. These consequences compromise nurse retention, ultimately threatening patient safety and care quality. This study investigated the impact of workplace bullying on male nurses’ professional identity through work engagement mediation and the fear of negative evaluation moderation, with the aim of informing supportive workplace interventions. METHOD: From January to March 2025, a nonrandom convenience sampling methodology was utilized to recruit 369 male nursing professionals across nine tertiary-level general hospitals located within comparable geographic regions of Sichuan Province. The survey included questions on general demographic data as well as research-related scales: the Negative Acts Questionnaire-Revised (NAQ-R), the Nurses’ Professional Identity Scale (PIS), the Utrecht Work Engagement Scale (UWES), and the Brief Fear of Negative Evaluation Scale (BFNES). SPSS version 26.0 was used to organize and analyze the data. RESULTS: This study initially recruited a cohort of 400 male nurses across surveyed institutions, with 369 complete datasets meeting the inclusion criteria retained for final analysis, yielding a 92.25% valid response rate. Hierarchical regression analysis indicated that workplace bullying and work engagement were significant factors influencing professional identity ( CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that workplace bullying and work engagement are independently associated with male nurses’ professional identity. Work engagement may serve as a partial mediator, whereas fear of negative evaluation appears to moderate both direct and indirect associations. Given the cross-sectional design, causal interpretations should be made cautiously. Nonetheless, these results provide valuable insights for developing targeted workplace interventions to support male nurses in bullying-prone settings.

A ternary-code DNA methylome atlas of mouse tissues.	BACKGROUND: DNA cytosine modifications, including 5-methylcytosine (5mC) and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), are key epigenetic regulators with distinct functions. Dissecting the ternary code (C, 5mC, 5hmC) across tissues and cell types remains a critical priority due to the limitations of traditional profiling methods based on bisulfite conversion. RESULTS: Here, we leverage the combined bisulfite and enzymatic (bACE) conversion with the Mouse Methylation BeadChip to generate 265 base-resolution ternary-code modification maps of 5mC and 5hmC across 29 mouse tissue types spanning 8-76 weeks of age and both sexes. Our atlas reveals a complex grammar of 5hmC distribution, jointly shaped by cell mitotic activity, chromatin states, and interplay with 5mC at the same and neighboring CpG sites. Of note, we demonstrate that 5hmC significantly complements 5mC-based biomarkers in delineating cell identity in both brain and non-brain tissues. Each modification state, including 5hmC alone, accurately discriminates tissue types, enabling high-precision machine learning classification of epigenetic identity. Furthermore, the ternary methylome variations extensively implicate gene transcriptional variation, with age-related changes correlated with gene expression in a tissue-dependent manner. CONCLUSIONS: Our work reveals how tissue, sex, and age jointly govern the dynamics of the two cytosine modifications, augments the scope of DNA modification biomarker discovery, and provides a reference atlas to explore epigenetic dynamics in development and disease.

Study on the needs of the older adults with dementia in care institutions based on a hierarchical interaction model: a case study of an institution in Hangzhou, China.	Dementia care is a significant public health challenge, particularly in institutional settings where standardized management often conflicts with individual needs. This research investigates the multifaceted needs of older adults with dementia in a Chinese care institution and the extent to which these needs are met. By constructing a stratified interactive framework for need analysis and employing methods such as field observations, in-depth interviews, and surveys, this study comprehensively assessed the satisfaction levels of residents' multidimensional needs. The findings indicate that while the physiological and safety needs of the residents were largely met, a significant deficit existed in their needs for love and belonging. Furthermore, the Eastern cultural context, with its emphasis on family and collective identity, also influenced the prioritization of needs among this population. Consequently, this study concludes that there is an urgent need to strengthen family interaction and personalized care and proposes a series of targeted interventions, offering theoretical and practical insights for the advancement of person-centered and precise institutional dementia care.

Remote intentional music listening intervention to support mental health in individuals with chronic stroke: study protocol for a feasibility trial.	INTRODUCTION: Poststroke depression affects approximately 30% of stroke survivors and is linked to worse functional outcomes, cognitive decline, reduced quality of life and increased mortality. While early treatment of poststroke mental health conditions is critical, current pharmacological options offer limited efficacy. Music listening interventions are a promising, low-risk, accessible and affordable alternative that may enhance recovery through engagement of reward-related brain circuits. However, most music listening studies have focused on the acute stage of stroke, lack objective measures of music engagement and rarely assess underlying neural mechanisms. To address these gaps, we propose a feasibility study of a remotely delivered music-listening intervention for individuals with chronic stroke, incorporating objective tracking of music exposure and multimodal assessments of mental health, cognitive, neural and physiological changes. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will conduct a parallel group randomised controlled feasibility trial enrolling 60 patients with chronic stroke from a well-characterised stroke registry in New York City. Participants will be randomised to either an intentional music listening (IML) group or an active control group that listens to audiobooks. The study includes a 4-week preintervention period during which no treatment is administered; this phase is designed to assess the stability of outcome measures. Following this, participants will engage in 1-hour daily listening sessions over a 4-week intervention period. All listening activity (ie, track identity, duration and engagement) will be continuously tracked using custom open-source software, providing a measure of treatment dose. Behavioural outcomes related to mental health will be assessed at baseline, preintervention, postintervention and 3-month follow-up. Multimodal biomarkers (functional and structural MRI, electrodermal activity and heart rate) will be collected preintervention and postintervention. The primary objective is to establish feasibility, defined by rates of retention and adherence, treatment fidelity, feasibility, acceptability and participant burden. Secondary outcomes include recruitment and randomisation rates. This trial will provide essential data to inform the design of future large-scale clinical studies of IML for poststroke mental health recovery. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study was approved by New York University's Institutional Review Board (FY2024-8826). All human participants will provide written informed consent prior to participation and will be adequately compensated for their time. Results will be reported in peer-reviewed journals.

Epigenetic Dysregulation in Neurodegenerative Disease: Implications for Neuropathology and Therapy.	Neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and Huntington's disease (HD) are characterized by progressive neuronal dysfunction, yet their underlying mechanisms remain incompletely understood. Emerging evidence implicates epigenetic dysregulation as a central contributor to the pathogenesis of these disorders. A thematic literature review was conducted across major databases using targeted search terms related to epigenetics and neurodegeneration. Studies were selected based on relevance, methodological quality, and contribution to mechanistic understanding, in accordance with Scale for the Assessment of Narrative Review Articles (SANRA) guidelines. Across AD, PD, and HD, distinct yet overlapping patterns of epigenetic alterations were identified. In AD, dysregulated DNA methylation and histone acetylation affect genes linked to amyloid and tau pathology. In PD, hypomethylation of SNCA and altered histone acetylation contribute to α-synuclein overexpression and neuronal loss. In HD, mutant huntingtin protein disrupts chromatin remodeling by sequestering histone acetyltransferases and altering microRNA expression. These changes disrupt neuronal identity, synaptic function, and inflammatory responses, often forming feedback loops that exacerbate disease progression. Epigenetic mechanisms play a pivotal role in neurodegeneration by mediating gene-environment interactions and perpetuating neuropathological changes. Their reversible nature presents opportunities for therapeutic intervention, though challenges related to specificity, delivery, and timing remain. Continued research into epigenetic biomarkers and precision-targeted epigenetic therapies holds promise for advancing early diagnosis and disease modification in NDDs.	alzheimer’s disease; biomarkers; epigenetics; huntington’s disease; neurodegeneration; parkinson’s disease

Work system analysis of health management for individuals with disabilities in supportive housing: a focus group study using the SEIPS framework.	PURPOSE: This study conducted a work-system analysis using the Systems Engineering Initiative for Patient Safety (SEIPS) framework to assess the flow of health-related information, and the current status of health management tasks for individuals with disabilities (IWD) in supportive housing. METHODS: This qualitative study utilized focus groups. Participants included a head of supportive housing, a team leader, a care coordinator and three personal support workers for IWD. Semi-structured interviews were guided by the SEIPS framework to explore the components of persons, tasks, tools and technology, organization, and environments. RESULTS: This study identified five key themes within the five SEIPS components: (1) disparities in role identity and health literacy among staff, (2) challenges in health care support reflecting a person-centered approach, (3) barriers in health-related information exchange and communication tools, (4) needs for organizational strategies or information communication, and (5) needs for integrating health-related information across external healthcare institutions. Additionally, 10 sub-themes were identified. CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide a comprehensive system-wide perspective and offer insights into the systematic approaches needed to improve healthcare processes and structures within disability supportive housing. Specifically, healthcare providers and effective tools for integrating health-related information are identified as critical components.

Evolving Psychotherapeutic Approaches for PTSD: Beyond the Fear-Based Model.	Traditional trauma-focused psychotherapies (TFPs) were developed based on an anxiety disorder model of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, PTSD is a more complex disorder with heterogeneous onset, presentation, trajectory, and treatment responsivity. As half of treated patients do not respond to first-line treatments, innovative therapies are emerging to improve outcomes. This narrative review of therapist-delivered psychotherapies for PTSD focuses on interventions not yet endorsed by clinical guidelines. A systematic search of MEDLINE and American Psychological Association PsycINFO was conducted for English-language human clinical studies, guidelines, and reviews related to PTSD psychotherapy through June 29, 2024. Data were thematically analyzed, focusing on how emerging interventions modify or diverge from current guideline-recommended treatments. The review identified 4 key themes for improving trauma therapy: (1) optimizing existing TFPs, (2) adapting psychotherapies used for other conditions, (3) reimagining exposure therapies, and (4) new therapeutic modalities. New exposure treatments include those capitalizing on memory reconsolidation science, combination with pharmacotherapies, neuromodulation, or virtual reality technologies, and mind-body and somatic psychotherapies. Moral injury, identity, and spirituality-focused therapies aim to resolve intense internal conflicts, guilt and shame, and issues of meaning and purpose. Finally, multi-modal treatments like 3MDR and psychedelic-assisted psychotherapies have multiple synergistic mechanisms. Ongoing research will be crucial to validating emerging approaches and optimizing their combined potential. A PTSD staging model may provide a structured framework for rigorous empirical evaluation and clinical implementation. Future research should prioritize randomized controlled trials with diverse patient populations and long-term follow-up to ensure their safety, efficacy, and scalability.

Neural mechanisms underlying implicit emotion regulation deficit in relational and nonrelational trauma PTSD: Insights from the Nested Hierarchical Model of Self.	BACKGROUND: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) exhibits marked heterogeneity, with relational (R; interpersonal) and nonrelational (NR; environmental) trauma subtypes demonstrating distinct psychopathological trajectories. Despite clinical recognition of these differences, their neurobiological underpinnings of emotion processing remain poorly understood. Guided by the Nested Hierarchical Model of Self (NHMS) - which posits trauma-type-specific disruptions in hierarchical self-processing systems - this study investigated neural mechanisms differentiating among PTSD subtypes during implicit emotion regulation. METHODS: A sample of 122 participants, including patients with PTSD (R: RESULTS: Results revealed that PTSD-R showed hypoactivation in right superior frontal gyrus (during implicit emotion regulation; BA9; CONCLUSIONS: These findings validate trauma-type-specific neural hierarchies, suggesting relational trauma disrupts top-down self-identity schemas, while NR trauma amplifies bottom-up threat detection. The study advances precision psychiatry by linking implicit regulation biomarkers to targeted interventions - cognitive restructuring for PTSD-R and interoceptive recalibration for PTSD-NR.	fusiform gyrus; implicit emotion regulation; posttraumatic stress disorder; relational trauma

The growing need for reliable biometric systems to identify children in contexts such as vaccination tracking, missing child recovery, and hospital safety has highlighted the importance of using robust physiological markers. EEG signals have emerged as promising biometric indicators due to their resistance to external manipulation and forgery. In this study, we investigated the influence of emotional facial expressions on EEG-based biometric identification in children with and without Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). EEG data were recorded from 25 typically developing (TD) children and 22 children diagnosed with ADHD during exposure to four emotional facial expressions: happy, sad, angry, and neutral. To evaluate the robustness of biometric identification across emotional states, brain connectivity features were extracted using various directed connectivity metrics (Directional Transfer Function (DTF), ffDTF, dDTF, dDTF08, Partial directional coherence (PDC)) and analyzed through clustering techniques based on Riemannian and Euclidean distances. The DTF feature combined with Riemannian distance-based clustering achieved the highest identification accuracies across all emotional states, reaching up to 100% for both groups. Specifically, accuracies of 99%, 99.4%, 99.6%, and 100% for healthy children and 100%, 99.77%, 99.77%, and 100% for ADHD children were obtained for sad, happy, angry, and neutral emotions, respectively. Statistical analysis confirmed the emotional resilience of the biometric system, showing no significant differences in identification accuracy between emotional states or between ADHD and TD groups. These findings support the feasibility of emotion-insensitive EEG-based biometric systems for child identification and highlight the utility of brain connectivity features in enhancing performance across neurodevelopmental populations.

Small Extracellular Vesicles in Neurodegenerative Disease: Emerging Roles in Pathogenesis, Biomarker Discovery, and Therapy.	Neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, ALS, and Huntington's pose a growing global challenge due to their complex pathobiology and aging demographics. Once considered as cellular debris, small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) are now recognized as active mediators of intercellular signaling in NDD progression. These nanovesicles (~30-150 nm), capable of crossing the blood-brain barrier, carry pathological proteins, RNAs, and lipids, facilitating the spread of toxic species like Aβ, tau, TDP-43, and α-synuclein. sEVs are increasingly recognized as valuable diagnostic tools, outperforming traditional CSF biomarkers in early detection and disease monitoring. On the therapeutic front, engineered sEVs offer a promising platform for CNS-targeted delivery of siRNAs, CRISPR tools, and neuroprotective agents, demonstrating efficacy in preclinical models. However, translational hurdles persist, including standardization, scalability, and regulatory alignment. Promising solutions are emerging, such as CRISPR-based barcoding, which enables high-resolution tracking of vesicle biodistribution; AI-guided analytics to enhance quality control; and coordinated regulatory efforts by the FDA, EMA, and ISEV aimed at unifying identity and purity criteria under forthcoming Minimal Information for Studies of Extracellular Vesicles (MISEV) guidelines. This review critically examines the mechanistic roles, diagnostic potential, and therapeutic applications of sEVs in NDDs, and outlines key strategies for clinical translation.	biomarkers; intercellular communication; liquid biopsy; neurodegenerative diseases; small extracellular vesicles; therapeutic delivery

Understanding the emergence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in adolescence from a brain and behavioral developmental perspective.	Suicide is a leading cause of death in adolescents, and a spectrum of suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STBs) is common among teenagers. Adolescence is a transitional period marked by critical brain changes, coinciding with major changes in how teenagers regulate emotions and impulses, as well as in how they understand themselves and interact with others. We review neuroimaging evidence supporting a developmental conceptualization of suicide risk, focusing on neural changes associated with key developmental tasks of adolescence. Functional and structural imaging studies have implicated medial prefrontal, cingulate, dorsolateral prefrontal, orbitofrontal, and frontolimbic circuitry changes in youth with STBs. There is emerging evidence that psychotherapeutic and neuromodulatory interventions can engage these brain processes and modify behavior in at-risk youth. We argue that harnessing these techniques more specifically by using targeted approaches aimed at enhancing emotion regulation, impulse control, positive identity development, and healthy social functioning is a promising way forward for reducing suicide risk in teens. Continued investigation into neural trajectories of suicidality in adolescence is critical for developing more effective risk assessment and treatment approaches to aid suicidal youth in navigating adolescent development and transitioning successfully to adulthood.

Associations Among Minority Stress, Allostatic Load, and Drug and Alcohol Use in Sexual Minorities: Protocol for the Queer Health Study-a Longitudinal Feasibility Evaluation.	"BACKGROUND: Substance use rates among sexual minorities are disproportionately greater than that of their heterosexual counterparts. Minority stress theory posits that one explanation for disproportionate substance use in sexual minority populations is a result of increased social stress associated with holding a minoritized identity. This minority stress has been linked to a myriad of negative mental health outcomes, including alcohol and drug use. In addition, emerging research has begun to demonstrate links between minority stress and stress physiology dysregulation. While animal and human models have demonstrated links between stress physiology dysregulation and substance use outcomes, to date, no studies have examined the role that stress physiology plays within a minority stress framework in predicting substance use among sexual minorities. The Queer Health Study was designed to explore the longitudinal links among minority stress, stress physiology (specifically, allostatic load, the cumulative ""wear and tear"" on the body and brain as a result of chronic stress), and substance use. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to assess the feasibility of collecting longitudinal data to explore the temporal links between minority stress processes, allostatic load, and drug and alcohol use, as well as to obtain estimates of effect size to determine the appropriate sample size necessary to conduct a fully powered longitudinal study. METHODS: This feasibility study is a 3-wave longitudinal design consisting of a self-report survey, researcher-assisted Timeline Followback to assess for drug and alcohol use, and blood and anthropometric data collection to measure allostatic load at each of the time points. A total of 40 ethnically and racially diverse sexual minority adult participants (aged 18-60 years) will be enrolled. RESULTS: The study received University of Houston institutional review board approval on July 31, 2023 (STUDY00004277). Recruitment began in June 2024. As of February 2025, the initial sample of 46 participants completed the time 1 visit, and time 2 visits are ongoing. We estimate that all study activities will be completed by July 2025. CONCLUSIONS: Results can inform the development of targeted prevention and treatment interventions. In addition, this research will provide an innovative framework for exploring diverse risk and resilience factors impacting addiction in this at-risk population. Ultimately, results have important implications for public health and have the potential to reduce the many dire economic and health consequences of drug use and addiction.

Direct SERS profiling of small extracellular vesicles in cerebrospinal fluid for pediatric medulloblastoma detection and treatment monitoring.	Definitive diagnosis of intracranial tumors by less-invasive approaches provides diagnostic information to facilitate personalized treatment decisions and avoid unnecessary invasive biopsy operations. However, it remains challenging, largely due to a lack of reliable molecular biomarkers. Here, we demonstrated that molecular profiles of small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) decoded by surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) revealed highly specific signatures to detect and accurately discriminate common primary intracranial tumors in children that can be challenging to distinguish using standard-of-care imaging. Specifically, the fabrication of silver nanocube-based three-dimensional SERS substrates enabled the acquisition of highly resolved Raman spectra of sEVs in clinical CSF samples. The development of stacking machine learning frameworks to analyze the Raman data sets unveiled differential vibrational modes and generated high accuracy for diagnosing pediatric medulloblastoma (MB), the most common malignant brain tumor in children, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC(ROC)) of 0.963. Furthermore, we observed high discriminative capacity of our Raman spectral classifier to distinguish MB from other brain tumors (AUC(ROC) = 0.906). Finally, we showed that dynamic analysis of the CSF sEV Raman profiles allowed monitoring of the therapeutic response of MB at the molecular level. Our study holds promise for facilitating precision medicine in brain tumors.	Cerebrospinal fluid; Exosomes; Liquid biopsy; Medulloblastoma; SERS fingerprinting

Rapid and accurate detection of hazardous volatile compounds is crucial for public health and environmental safety. While conventional methods, including electronic noses, typically exhibit detection thresholds in the parts-per-million (ppm) range, many harmful substances pose risks at parts-per-billion (ppb) concentrations or lower. To address this challenge, we leverage the exceptional sensitivity of the mammalian olfactory system, specifically that of Rattus norvegicus (lab rat), which has evolved to detect and discriminate a vast array of odors at extremely low concentrations. In this study, we developed a novel bio-hybrid system that integrates behavioral training with in vivo electrophysiological recordings from the olfactory bulb (OB). Rats were operantly conditioned to recognize target odors, namely TNT (2,4,6-trinitrotoluene), TNP (2,4,6-trinitrophenol), and chlorine gas (Cl	Brain-computer interface; Cl(2); Odor detection; Olfactory bulb electrode arrays; ppb

Public Attitudes Toward Xenotransplantation in South Korea: A 2023 Survey Study.	BACKGROUND: Xenotransplantation is a promising field to solve the problem of insufficient allograft and has been actively studied in Korea. However, there are a number of ethical, legal, and social issues to consider, and it is necessary to know the public attitudes regarding them. METHODS: A Computer Aided Web Interview consisting of 22 questionnaire items was conducted to investigate the attitudes of Korean related to xenotransplantation. Participants were selected from Hankook Research MS (Master Sample) panel. A total of 1007 sets of data were finally collected and analyzed with SPSS. A statistical analysis was performed using an independent t-test and chi-square method. RESULTS: 72.9% of the respondents were positive about xenotransplantation, while 22.2% negative. 61.7% said that they would accept xenotransplantation for incurable diseases. 64.4% agreed with genetically modified pigs for organ resource. 61% agreed that the brain dead could be transplanted first for research purpose, while 32.7% disagreed. The ratio of response that the risk of zoonotic infection is important was 97.2%; the safety issue due to immunosuppression 98.7%; the human identity issue after transplantation 67.4%; and the animal right issue 51.6%. Men were more favorable to xenotransplantation than women on all but one item (stigmatization). There was no significant difference between religions except for the human identity issue. CONCLUSION: Korean people are favorable to xenotransplantation as a therapeutic option and also positive with the use of pig even genetically modified in spite of the issue of animal rights. They are also positive with the idea of using the brain dead as study subject for xenotransplantation, which is currently forbidden in Korea.

The needs, preferences, and experiences of LGBT + people living with dementia: a systematic review with thematic synthesis.	BACKGROUND: LGBT + people are disproportionately at an increased risk for developing dementia. Dementia can compound the impact of stigma and social marginalisation experienced by LGBT + people, and is likely to create barriers to accessing healthcare services. Understanding the needs, preferences, and experiences of LGBT + people with dementia will help support high quality individualised care. The aim of this review is to explore and synthesise the evidence on the needs, preferences, and experiences of LGBT + people with dementia. METHODS: Systematic review with thematic synthesis. The search strategy combined concepts of gender and sexual minorities, and dementia. MEDLINE Complete, PsycInfo, CINAHL, and Academic Search Ultimate were searched until March 2024. Relevant published papers in the English language were included, regardless of design or type. Data were analysed using thematic analysis. Findings were discussed from a queer lens. RESULTS: Out of 1537 initial titles, 16 papers were included. Majority were published in the UK (n = 8), followed by USA (n = 4), Canada (n = 2), and Australia (n = 2). Of 16 papers, two were empirical qualitative studies, one used a subset of qualitative data from a previous study alongside other sources (literature review, reflection, policy) for data analysis, and 13 papers were non-empirical. The experiences primarily focused on actual or anticipated discrimination, and how the lifetime experiences of oppression, trauma, and other stressors can impact on the experience of dementia. Many of the needs captured focused on safety and control in identity disclosure and expression, and access to love, intimacy, and social networks. In addition, maintaining personhood through institutional safety, psychological safety, and attachment through relationships and couplehood were highlighted. Data on preferences were not explicit. CONCLUSION: The robustness of the science is weak regarding the needs, preferences, and experiences of LGBT + people with dementia. Designing and implementing dementia-related policies through a queer intersectional lens, along with embedded cultural safety education programmes, are needed. Further research that includes the voice of LGBT + people with dementia coupled with healthcare professionals' perspective is needed.

Altered T-cell reactivity in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease.	The adaptive immune system and neurodegenerative Alzheimer's disease (AD) are intertwined in multiple ways. Recent studies have reported alterations of the adaptive immune system in early AD stages, such as preclinical AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to AD. However, the identity of specific antigenic targets and whether the respective response is beneficial or detrimental during disease progression are still open questions. Herein, we describe cross-sectional analyses of blood and CSF from three different study populations covering early AD stages. We employed high-dimensional mass cytometry, single-cell RNA-sequencing, ex vivo T-cell secretome analysis, and antigen presentation assays to achieve a comprehensive characterization of adaptive immune cell populations. Our results show that subjects at the stage of asymptomatic, preclinical AD can mount a CD4+ T helper cell response towards amyloid-β peptide and display an early enrichment of CD8+ T effector memory cells re-expressing CD45RA (TEMRA cells) in CSF, combined with a less immunosuppressive gene signature of peripheral regulatory T cells. Conversely, in MCI we observed increased frequencies of CD8+ TEMRA/effector cells in the periphery characterized by a pro-inflammatory gene expression profile, and generally decreased antigen responsiveness. Our results demonstrate the complexity of adaptive immune changes in early AD and suggest that it may be beneficial to promote specific CD4+ T-cell responses in the preclinical stage, while in MCI it may be important to therapeutically target CD8+ T-cell responses if these prove to be harmful.

The Effectiveness of a Race-Based Stress Reduction Intervention on Improving Stress-Related Symptoms and Inflammation in African American Women at Risk for Cardiometabolic Disease: Protocol for Recruitment and Intervention for a Randomized Controlled Trial.	BACKGROUND: In recent years, the prevalence of cardiometabolic disease (CMD) in African American women has risen; the risk also increases with age, in comparison to men. Evidence demonstrates that stressful life events, including experiences of racism and perceived discrimination, contribute substantially to inflammatory diseases, such as CMD. Despite this evidence, few evidence-based interventions are available to assist individuals from minoritized communities in coping with the chronic stress related to their racial or ethnic identity. OBJECTIVE: Our proposed randomized controlled trial will test a novel, race-based intervention tailored to African American women, called Resilience, Stress, and Ethnicity (RiSE). METHODS: In this randomized controlled trial, we will randomize participants 1:1 to the 8-week, group-based RiSE program (intervention) or a health education program (active control group). Both programs will consist of synchronous classes on Zoom and will be led by experts. The primary end point will be stress at 6 months after the intervention, and the efficacy of RiSE will be evaluated for improving stress-related symptoms (current perceived stress, depressive symptoms, fatigue, and sleep disturbance), improving coping strategies, and reducing inflammatory burden in African American women at risk for CMD. Validated survey measures and inflammatory biomarkers will be assessed at baseline, midintervention, intervention completion, and 6 months after the intervention, and differences over time by intervention will be evaluated using mixed effects models. RESULTS: This study was funded by the National Institute on Aging on March 30, 2023, with recruitment and enrollment beginning in October 2023. The study is underway, with 120 participants enrolled as of March 2025. CONCLUSIONS: This study will be one of the first to examine a race-based stress reduction intervention in African American women and has the potential to improve the health of minoritized groups faced with chronic stress associated with experiencing racism and discrimination. We anticipate that RiSE will reduce stress-related symptoms, enhance adaptive coping, and reduce inflammation.

Strain-specific variations in the culture of chicken primordial germ cells.	Efficient long-term cultivation of chicken primordial germ cells (cPGCs) is essential for various avian research and biotechnology applications. Our study aimed to address the challenge of inconsistent culture success by investigating strain-specific variations and optimizing culture conditions using two distinct media: Ovotransferrin-enriched medium (OTM) and chicken serum-supplemented medium (CSM). We demonstrated that each chicken strain has unique nutritional requirements, with Hubbard cPGCs thriving in OTM and Bovans cPGCs favoring CSM. This strain-specific variation was effective in derivation and proliferation rates and the expression of stem cell-specific markers such as POU5F3/OCT4 and NANOG. Furthermore, our study confirmed the sustained germ cell identity of long-term cultured cPGCs through the expression of DAZL, DDX4, and EMA1 germ cell markers. We also showed that cultured cPGCs retained their migratory abilities and transfectability, successfully generating G0 germline chimeras and G1 transgenic Bovans chickens. These findings highlight the importance of optimized culture conditions depending on the genotype to enhance the viability and genetic stability of cPGCs, paving the way for more effective genetic modifications and conservation strategies in avian species.

A head-to-head comparison of S100B and GFAP/UCH-L1 for detection of traumatic intracranial lesions in a Scandinavian trauma cohort.	BACKGROUND: Few countries recommend glial fibrillary protein (GFAP) and ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase-L1 (UCH-L1) as a substitute for S100 astroglial calcium-binding protein B (S100B) in early detection of traumatic intracranial lesions in mild TBI (mTBI). This study aims to evaluate the classification agreement between S100B and GFAP/UCH-L1 in a Scandinavian trauma cohort, to evaluate the performance characteristics of S100B and GFAP/UCH-L1 for detection of traumatic intracranial lesions, and lastly to evaluate the laboratory performance of the GFAP/UCH-L1 assay. METHODS: Prospectively collected data from an unselected cohort of 379 adult trauma patients admitted to a level I trauma center at Aarhus University Hospital, Denmark, were retrospectively analyzed. Analyses were performed in the unselected cohort, in sub-cohort 1 (n = 218) i.e. patients with any evidence of TBI in their chart as well as in sub-cohort 2 (n = 105) i.e. patients with mTBI defined as Glasgow Coma Scale score ≥ 14, an injury severity score ≤ 15, and blood sampling within 6 h or 12 h after trauma. Plasma-samples were used for GFAP/UCH-L1 measurement and serum-samples were used for S100B measurement. Data analysis involved agreement analysis using Cohens kappa and sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value for each biomarker in each of the three cohorts. Lastly, levels of GFAP/UCH-L1 measured by the Alinity-I platform and the Simoa platform were compared. RESULTS: Classification agreement between GFAP/UCH-L1 and S100B was high in all three cohorts, but Cohens kappa improved with increasing proximity to clinical biomarker use and reached an almost perfect identity in sub-cohort 2 (0.70, 95% CI 0.62-0.92). S100b had a sensitivity and negative predictive value of 100% in sub-cohort 2, while GFAP/UCH-L1 reached 100% across all three cohorts. The specificities for both S100B and GFAP/UCH-L1 were relatively low. Comparing GFAP/UCH-L1 levels between platforms revealed a low concordance with the Alinity-I platform measuring GFAP levels on average 65% lower and UCH-L1 levels 84% higher than the Simoa platform. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, S100B and GFAP/UCH-L1 had an almost perfect agreement for classification of mTBI patients and comparable diagnostic performances for detecting traumatic intracranial lesions. Our results therefore support GFAP/UCH-L1 as a feasible alternative to S100B for detecting traumatic intracranial lesions in mTBI.

Obfuscation via pitch-shifting for balancing privacy and diagnostic utility in voice-based cognitive assessment.	INTRODUCTION: Digital voice analysis is an emerging tool for differentiating cognitive states, but it poses privacy risks as automated systems may inadvertently identify speakers. METHODS: We developed a computational framework to evaluate the trade-off between voice obfuscation and cognitive assessment accuracy, using pitch-shifting as a representative method. This framework was applied to voice recordings from the Framingham Heart Study (FHS, n = 128) and the DementiaBank Delaware (DBD, n = 85) corpus, both featuring responses to neuropsychological tests. Speaker obfuscation was measured via equal error rate (EER), and diagnostic utility was assessed through machine learning models distinguishing cognitive states: normal cognition (NC), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and dementia (DE). RESULTS: With the top 20 acoustic features, our framework achieved classification accuracies of 62.2% (EER: 0.3335) on the FHS dataset for NC, MCI, and DE differentiation, and 63.7% (EER: 0.1796) on the DBD dataset for NC and MCI differentiation, using obfuscated speech files. DISCUSSION: Our results demonstrate the feasibility of privacy-preserving voice markers, offering a scalable solution for voice-based cognitive assessments. HIGHLIGHTS: We developed a computational framework using pitch-shifting and acoustic transformations to balance speaker privacy and diagnostic utility in voice-based cognitive assessments. We evaluated the framework on two independent datasets, Framingham Heart Study (FHS, n = 128) and DementiaBank Delaware (DBD, n = 85) corpus, assessing the trade-off between privacy (measured by equal error rate [EER]) and classification accuracy. Our framework achieved classification accuracies of 62.2% (EER: 0.3335) for distinguishing normal cognition (NC), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and dementia in the FHS dataset and 63.7% (EER: 0.1796) for NC and MCI differentiation in the DBD dataset, using obfuscated speech files. Our framework demonstrates that pitch-shifting levels can preserve diagnostic utility while protecting speaker identity, offering a scalable and privacy-preserving solution.	cognitive assessment; digital health; privacy; voice recordings

"Age and Inflammation: Insights on ""Age Three Ways"" from Midlife in the United States Study."	"INTRODUCTION: Chronological age is a particularly well-known indicator of variability in systemic inflammation. Other pertinent aspects of age (or ""age proxies"") - subjective or epigenetic age - may offer nuanced information about age and inflammation associations. Using the Midlife in the United States Study, we explored how chronological, subjective, and epigenetic age were associated with inflammation. Further, we tested whether chronological age remained a unique predictor of inflammation after accounting for the variance of subjective and epigenetic age. Using an intersectionality framework, we also tested whether associations differed by race and gender. METHOD: 1,307 (85.39% White, 52.99% men) participants reported on their chronological and subjective age and provided blood from which epigenetic DNA and inflammatory biomarkers (IL-6, IL-8, fibrinogen, TNF-α, and E-selectin) were determined. RESULTS: Linear regressions showed that being chronologically older was related to higher levels of inflammation. Being biologically older (higher epigenetic age or pace of aging) was also related to higher levels of all but IL-8. Subjective age was related to inflammatory biomarkers but only for people who identified their racial identity as White. Gender differences emerged, primarily with biological and chronological age. With all age indicators in one model, chronological age remained a unique indicator of inflammation in the sample, as similar to or a better predictor than biological age. CONCLUSION: The current study provides a better scientific understanding of the relative association of chronological age versus subjective and epigenetic age on inflammation with evidence suggesting that chronological age provides novel information above and beyond other proxies of age."

OBJECTIVES: To examine CT radiation dose variation in PET-CT and understand how often providers use diagnostic vs lower doses for attenuation correction and anatomic localization (AC/AL). METHODS: Retrospective, multi-centered study of PET-CT exams from 2010 to 2021. Exams were categorized as body or brain. Radiation dose was quantified using dose length product (DLP), adjusted for patient size (DLP RESULTS: Sixty-four thousand two hundred ten exams included 93% body, 7% brain. Doses were higher and more variable in the body than brain exams (adult mean DLP CONCLUSION: While diagnostic CT is sometimes indicated for PET-CT, body exams generally do not use AC/AL protocols. Doses were higher than previously reported, higher than analogous diagnostic CT exams, and higher in older children than adults when size adjusted. KEY POINTS: Question How does CT radiation dose vary in PET-CT and how often do providers use diagnostic vs lower doses for AC/AL? Findings Most facilities did not use AC/AL protocols for body PET-CT, and CT effective doses were higher than previously reported. Clinical relevance The considerable inter-facility variation observed suggests ample opportunity to reduce ionizing radiation doses for CT in body PET-CT by adopting low-dose (AC/AL) protocols and other dose reduction techniques.

LGBTQ+ identity and its association with inflammation and cellular immune function.	Self-identification among lesbian, gay, transgender, queer, and other sexual minorities (LGBTQ+) is complex and multifaceted, yet few studies have examined its impact on immune parameters. The National Couples' Health and Time Study (NCHAT) is a nationally-representative cohort of 3,642 adult main respondents, ages 20 to 60 years, who are married or cohabiting, among whom 45 % self-identify as a non-heterosexual identity. Biological data were collected from a subset in the NCHAT Stress Biology study (NCHAT-BIO). The current analyses focus on data from 289 participants in NCHAT-BIO who identified as a non-heterosexual identity. Participants self-reported demographic, mental health, and LGBTQ+ identity items. Finger stick dried blood spot (DBS) sampling was self-administered by participants and assayed for C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and antibodies against Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Multivariable regression analyses were used to assess the relationship between each of the biomarkers and: 1) individual LGBTQ+ identity items and 2) latent profiles of LGBTQ+ identity items. Models were adjusted for demographic factors and other confounders. Among those assigned female at birth, a greater sense of pride in one's LGBTQ+ identity was associated with lower EBV antibody levels. Among those assigned male at birth, greater desire to keep one's identity private was associated with elevated CRP while those who would choose to be straight or wish they were heterosexual had elevated levels of IL-6. Meanwhile, being proud of one's LGBTQ+ identity predicted lower IL-6. These results provide novel evidence from a large sample that internalized stigma related to one's LGBTQ+ identity is associated with elevated inflammation and poorer cellular immune function while identity affirmation is associated with reduced inflammation. Future research should aim to develop and target both behavioral and biomedical interventions aimed at reducing health disparities among sexual minority populations.

Genomic Scale Analysis Foresees Enteroprotective and Butyrogenic Properties in Brazilian Isolates of Lactiplantibacillus plantarum.	Probiogenomics offers a rapid and comprehensive approach to characterizing the beneficial properties of microorganisms, allowing the identification and selection of specific strains for improving human health. The species Lactiplantibacillus plantarum is highly ubiquitous and presents great genetic diversity making it difficult to conduct massive screening of probiotic strains when using conventional methods. Hence, this work aimed to taxonomically and functionally characterize the complete genomes of six novel L. plantarum strains isolated in Brazil through high-standard NGS. The taxonomy of strains E6, E10, E14, E18, Lpl2, and Lpl4 was investigated through average nucleotide identity analysis using the genome of L. plantarum SK151 from the GENBANK database as a reference. Moreover, multilocus phylogenetic analyses were performed to investigate their genetic relatedness to probiotic L. plantarum strains using a total of 225 complete genomes from the same database. To investigate specific health-promoting and safety properties, the isolates from Brazil were analyzed using several bioinformatic tools to predict antimicrobials and anti-inflammatory biomolecules and potential risk factors including drug resistance, virulence genes, and genetic mobility elements. The results confirmed that all six isolates belong to the species L. plantarum and the phylogenetic analysis suggests high proximity to known probiotics and strains that have demonstrated protective effects against inflammation and pathogens. Several bacteriocin genes were identified in the Brazilian isolates, mostly plantaricins, suggesting antimicrobial properties, especially in the strain E14 that presented 9 bacteriocins genes. Furthermore, the study revealed the potential capacity of these strains to produce anti-inflammatory compounds including metabolites such as butyrate through the fermentation of fructan sugars, and IL-10 stimulation activity mediated by adhesin proteins from the bacterial cell wall. The lpl4 strain glutamate decarboxylase (GADB) gene showed a high degree of genetic and structural conservation prediction and increased stabilization of the predicted protein compared to a functional homologous GADB from L. plantarum Taj-Apis362, suggesting lpl4 potential for the modulation of the gut-brain axis functions by the production of GABA. Regarding the presence of virulence and resistance genes, only one resistance island was observed in strain E6 genome. In conclusion, it is possible to suggest that most of the evaluated strains are safe and we highlight the strains Lpl4 and E14 for presenting outstanding enteroprotective properties such as the potential production of GABA and several bacteriocins.

Laboratory Monitoring in Transgender and Gender-Diverse Individuals.	BACKGROUND: Increasing numbers of transgender and gender-diverse individuals are seeking initiation of gender-affirming hormone therapy. This aligns an individual's physical characteristics with their gender identity and improves psychological outcomes. Physical changes, including changes to muscle mass and body fat redistribution, can alter sex-specific laboratory reference ranges. CONTENT: We review the impact of gender-affirming hormone therapy on laboratory parameters with sex-specific reference ranges, with a focus on hemoglobin/hematocrit, renal function, cardiac biomarkers, and prostate-specific antigen. SUMMARY: Gender-affirming hormone therapy results in changes in laboratory parameters with sex-specific reference ranges. For individuals established on gender-affirming hormone therapy, reference ranges that align with an individual's gender identity should be used for hemoglobin/hematocrit, serum creatinine, and high-sensitivity cardiac troponin and N-terminal brain natriuretic peptide. Clinicians should interpret these biomarkers according to the reference range that aligns with one's affirmed gender.

Australian occupational therapists' perspectives about the management of driving safety concerns for older people with dementia and mild cognitive impairment.	INTRODUCTION: Driving safety may be compromised in people with dementia or mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Occupational therapists assess and screen for driving safety in older people with cognitive impairment. However, little is known about their perspectives relating to these assessments. Aims included to (1) obtain perspectives from driver-trained and non-driver-trained occupational therapists about the management of driving safety concerns for older people with dementia and MCI; (2) understand factors influencing clinician's behaviour relating to driving assessment; and (3) gain perspectives regarding resources to support fitness-to-drive assessment. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with occupational therapists recruited from driving assessment services, hospitals, and community settings in Australia. Data were analysed inductively using content analysis, followed by a deductive approach with two authors mapping subcategories to the domains of the Theoretical Domains Framework and Capability, Opportunity and Motivation-Behaviour model. CONSUMER AND COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT: No consumers were involved in the design or study analysis. FINDINGS: Participants (n = 17) reported inconsistencies in how the fitness-to-drive assessment is managed, with driving safety concerns often missed or avoided. Perceived barriers to fitness-to-drive assessment included: (i) clinician's capabilities: limited knowledge about fitness-to-drive assessment, and difficulties having complex discussions with patients with cognitive impairment; (ii) motivational factors: lack of confidence, fear of damaging therapeutic relationship with patients, and desire to maintain a sense of professional identity; and (iii) environmental factors: lack of processes to support health professionals with identifying cognitive concerns, lack of clarity of who takes responsibility for managing driving safety concerns, time constraints for completing in-office assessments and limited access to practical occupational therapy driving assessments. Participants expressed a desire for an evidence-based clinical pathway to improve the knowledge and communication skills of clinicians from non-driving specialist settings. CONCLUSION: Findings identify the need for an evidence-based pathway to support health professionals in managing driving safety concerns for people with dementia and MCI. PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY: Dementia and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) are brain conditions involving difficulty with memory and thinking, with dementia diagnosed when the changes are more severe. These conditions are not a normal part of getting older, but they are much more common in older people. Research has found that some, but not all, people with dementia and MCI show unsafe driving behaviours. As people with dementia and MCI are often unaware that their driving is unsafe, health professionals, such as doctors and occupational therapists, should be involved in deciding if, or when, they should stop driving. In this study, occupational therapists were asked to provide their opinions about how driving safety concerns for older people with dementia and MCI are managed by health professionals. Occupational therapists reported that there is variation in how concerns are managed, with driving problems often getting missed or avoided. They reported that this can happen because health professionals may not feel confident in their decision-making abilities, or they may feel that discussing driving concerns will cause the person to get upset or angry with them. They also reported that health professionals may not always know that a person has dementia or MCI, and if they do know, it is not always clear which health professional should take on the responsibility of considering the person's driving safety. The occupational therapists wanted a resource to support health professionals in providing more consistent care for patients relating to driving safety.	automobile driving; clinical decision‐making; cognitive dysfunction; dementia; occupational therapists

Perceptions about preclinical Alzheimer's disease biomarker collection procedure influences willingness to participate: Findings from an ethnoracially diverse study.	BACKGROUND: Past research suggests that ethnoracialized groups differ in their willingness to engage in preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD) research overall. Studies indicated that participation willingness was affected by attitudes toward research and perceived invasiveness of biomarker collection techniques. However, comparative quantitative studies are few, and minoritized groups are under-included. OBJECTIVE: In a cross-sectional online survey, we sought to explore community-based adults' willingness to engage in preclinical AD biomarker testing, comparing their attitudes about research and different types of biomarker procedures. METHODS: We conducted an online survey with a diverse group of participants. African American (AA), American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN), Latinx (LTX), and Non-Hispanic White (NHW) adults aged 26-90 were asked about their research attitudes, biomarkers, and willingness to participate in specific biomarker test procedures (i.e., brain imaging via PET scanning, blood draws, and cerebrospinal fluid collection by lumbar puncture). We also assessed participants' perceived safety, burden, and distress for each of the three biomarker collection methods. To understand the association between research willingness and ethnoracial identity, we ran linear regression models for each procedure, adjusting for age, gender, educational attainment, and attitudes toward research. RESULTS: The AA group expressed greater willingness to engage in biomarker testing involving blood draws than the NHW group. The AI/AN group was significantly less willing to undergo lumbar puncture than the NHW group; this difference remained after adjusting for various sociodemographic factors and research attitudes. CONCLUSIONS: Respondents' willingness to engage in preclinical AD biomarker research was affected by their perceptions about the testing collection procedure.

Molecular Biomarkers Associated with Traumatic Brain Injury Outcome in Individuals of Black Racial Identity or African Ancestry: A Narrative Review.	Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide and a major global health concern. In the United States, individuals of Black or African American racial identity experience disproportionately higher rates of TBI and suffer from worse postinjury outcomes. Contemporary research agendas have largely overlooked or excluded Black populations, resulting in the continued marginalization of Black patient populations in TBI studies, thereby limiting the generalizability of ongoing research to patients in the United States and around the world. This review aims to highlight what is currently known, and identify knowledge gaps, in research on molecular biomarkers associated with TBI in Black populations. A PubMed literature search was conducted to identify studies that investigate molecular biomarkers associated with TBI outcomes that include participants of Black racial identity and those of African ancestry. Studies identified for this review investigate biomarkers associated with TBI outcomes through a lens that specifically examines race, ethnicity, or ancestry. Most studies focused on blood- or cerebrospinal fluid-derived protein biomarkers. Studies identified statistical variation in S100ß, ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase-L1, amyloid-ß, and tau across participant race, either at baseline or following TBI. Additionally, several studies identified genetic polymorphisms associated with TBI outcomes related to apolipoprotein E, ANKK1, and COMT polymorphism and TBI outcome and identified allele frequency variation across population ancestry. The role of race and ancestry on biomarkers associated with TBI outcome remains indeterminate and subsequent work is still required to understand the implications for patients with TBI.

INTRODUCTION: Digital voice analysis is gaining traction as a tool to differentiate cognitively normal from impaired individuals. However, voice data poses privacy risks due to the potential identification of speakers by automated systems. METHODS: We developed a framework that uses weighted linear interpolation of privacy and utility metrics to balance speaker obfuscation and cognitive integrity in cognitive assessments. This framework applies pitch-shifting for speaker obfuscation while preserving cognitive speech features. We tested it on digital voice recordings from the Framingham Heart Study (N=128) and Dementia Bank Delaware corpus (N=85), both containing responses to neuropsychological tests. RESULTS: The tool effectively obfuscated speaker identity while maintaining cognitive feature integrity, achieving an accuracy of 0.6465 in classifying individuals with normal cognition, mild cognitive impairment, and dementia in the FHS cohort. DISCUSSION: Our approach enables the development of digital markers for dementia assessment while protecting sensitive personal information, offering a scalable solution for privacy-preserving voice-based diagnostics.

Lower creatinine-to-cystatin c ratio associated with increased risk of incident amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in the prospective UK biobank cohort.	Reduced muscle mass has been associated with the progression and prognosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). However, it remains unclear whether decreased muscle mass is a risk factor for ALS or a consequence of motor neuron degeneration. Recently, serum creatinine-to-cystatin C ratio (CCR) have emerged as promising biomarkers for assessing muscle mass. We aimed to explore the association between CCR and the incidence of ALS using data from the UK Biobank. Between 2006 and 2010, 446,945 participants were included in the baseline. CCR was calculated as the ratio of serum creatinine to cystatin C. Cox regression models were used to analyze the relationship between CCR and ALS incidence. Furthermore, subgroup analyses were conducted to investigate potential covariates in these relationships. After adjusting for all covariates, the multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed a significant association between decreased CCR and an increased risk of ALS (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.990, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.982-0.999, P = 0.026). Participants were stratified into groups based on CCR tertiles. Compared with participants in the highest tertiles of CCR, those in the lowest (HR = 1.388, 95% CI: 1.032-1.866, P = 0.030) and medium tertiles (HR = 1.348, 95% CI: 1.045-1.739, P = 0.021) had an increased risk of ALS incidence. Subgroup analysis showed that the relationship between CCR and ALS incidence was particularly significant among participants aged < 65 years (CCR tertile 1: HR = 1.916, 95% CI: 1.366-2.688, P < 0.001; CCR tertile 2: HR = 1.699, 95% CI: 1.267-2.278, P < 0.001). The present results demonstrate that lower CCR is significantly associated with a higher risk of ALS.	Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; Creatinine; Cystatin C; Muscle mass; UK biobank

Human iPSC-derived neural stem cells displaying radial glia signature exhibit long-term safety in mice.	Human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neural stem/progenitor cells (hiPSC-NSCs) hold promise for treating neurodegenerative and demyelinating disorders. However, comprehensive studies on their identity and safety remain limited. In this study, we demonstrate that hiPSC-NSCs adopt a radial glia-associated signature, sharing key epigenetic and transcriptional characteristics with human fetal neural stem cells (hfNSCs) while exhibiting divergent profiles from glioblastoma stem cells. Long-term transplantation studies in mice showed robust and stable engraftment of hiPSC-NSCs, with predominant differentiation into glial cells and no evidence of tumor formation. Additionally, we identified the Sterol Regulatory Element Binding Transcription Factor 1 (SREBF1) as a regulator of astroglial differentiation in hiPSC-NSCs. These findings provide valuable transcriptional and epigenetic reference datasets to prospectively define the maturation stage of NSCs derived from different hiPSC sources and demonstrate the long-term safety of hiPSC-NSCs, reinforcing their potential as a viable alternative to hfNSCs for clinical applications.

Disentangling gender, sex, and biology: a mixed methods study of gender identity data collection tools.	"OBJECTIVES: We used community-based mixed methods to test whether transgender and gender diverse (TGD) people preferred gender identity questions developed by community members over current questions in use and generate hypotheses about data collection preferences. METHODS: We interviewed twenty TGD adults in English and Spanish, asking them to rate and discuss their responses to questions. We analyzed quantitative data with descriptive statistics and qualitative data with template analysis, then integrated them. RESULTS: More participants preferred gender identity questions that were currently in use. Themes: 1) TGD participants find questions about ""gender"" and related terminology unclear because of conflations of sex, gender, and other constructs. 2) TGD participants resist cisgenderism in questions about gender identity. 3) TGD people desire questions that allow for autonomy, privacy, and safety. 4) Contextual factors, particularly safety, influence whether and how TGD people answer questions about gender and sex. CONCLUSIONS: TGD people have varied concepts of sex and gender and preferences about data collection. Future research should investigate the impacts of disentangling gender, sex, and biological factors, which could decrease stigma for TGD people. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Medical care that disentangles gender, sex, and biological factors could improve data collection effectiveness and the safety of TGD people."

Police Avoidance Among Black Youth.	OBJECTIVES: Police violence is a public health crisis that disproportionately impacts youth of color, particularly Black youth. These disparities may also compel Black youth to engage in police avoidance (ie, efforts to circumvent police contact and surveillance). Even so, research on Black youths' engagement in police avoidance is lacking. The present study is the first to investigate factors that may underpin police avoidance among Black youth. METHODS: Data come from the Survey of Police-Adolescent Contact Experiences (SPACE), a recent, cross-sectional, non-probability survey of Black youth (around 52% male) aged 12-21 in Baltimore City, Maryland (n = 345). RESULTS: Findings indicate that youth 1) identifying as bisexual or queer, 2) perceiving lower safety at home and in their neighborhoods, 3) reporting more negative attitudes about police, and 4) engaging in delinquent behaviors reported significantly greater police avoidance. Furthermore, youth who reported a greater number of known persons stopped by the police (eg, family members, friends, neighbors) and had personally experienced officer intrusion during direct or witnessed stops (eg, harsh language, threats of force, use of force) also exhibited greater police avoidance. CONCLUSIONS: Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and queer (LGBQ) identity, reduced perceptions of environmental safety, negative attitudes about police, delinquent behaviors, and multiple types of police exposure may shape police avoidance among Black youth. Findings have the potential to inform targeted strategies to mitigate racial and LGBQ disparities in adolescent well-being. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: None.

Comprehensive feedback on user experiences with brain injury identification cards.	"PURPOSE/OBJECTIVE: Brain injuries are often ""invisible"" injuries that can have lifelong consequences including changes in identity, functional independence, relationships, and reduced participation in daily activities. Survivors of brain injury experience stigma and challenges related to the misattribution of symptoms to other causes that are significant barriers to recovery and adjustment. Changes in policy and other large-scale interventions are cited as an underexplored, yet critical path to reducing the impact of brain injury. The present study sought to comprehensively characterize the impact of one such initiative-Brain Injury Identification Cards-among survivors to further refine the resource. RESEARCH METHOD/DESIGN: In this cross-sectional qualitative focus group study, we recruited 16 individuals with a history of brain injury via email listservs of individuals who registered for a Brain Injury Identification Card. We used rapid data analysis with a hybrid of deductive and inductive analytic strategies to identify themes within a priori domains. RESULTS: We extracted themes within four domains: (a) process and reasons for obtaining cards; (b) overall impressions of the cards; (c) uses of the cards; and (d) feedback and proposed changes. Participants described the process of obtaining cards as straightforward and shared wide-ranging benefits across domains, including improving survivors' sense of safety, self-advocacy, and ability to participate in daily activities. CONCLUSIONS/IMPLICATIONS: Findings highlight the utility of Brain Injury Identification Cards for improving community understanding of brain injury symptoms and how injury-related challenges may manifest in daily life.

Abnormal sensory processing is core to neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders, such as schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorders. Developing efficient therapies requires understanding the basic sensory pathways and identifying circuit abnormalities during early development. Auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) are well-established biomarkers for auditory processing on the brainstem level. Beyond their advantage of being easily applicable in clinics (given their non-invasive nature), ABRs have high reproducibility in rodents and translate well to humans (e.g. wave identity), despite species differences (e.g. wave features). We hypothesized that ABRs would reveal sensory abnormalities in neurodevelopmental models with construct validity, such as Neurexin1α knockout (Nrxn1α KO) rats during their development. In a previous study, adult Nrxn1α KO rats showed altered cortical auditory-evoked potentials and impaired prediction error to auditory stimuli (Janz in Transl Psychiat, 12:455, 2022 ). This study used ABR measurements to assess brainstem physiology during auditory processing in Nrxn1α KO rats and their wild-type littermates. Therefore, we followed the development trajectories of ABRs from the age of 3 weeks to 12 weeks longitudinally. We found that juvenile Nrxn1α KO rats (3 weeks of age) show altered ABRs, which normalized during further development. This alteration was confined to increased latency in waves II, III, and IV of the ABRs, suggesting impaired auditory processing on the level of the superior olivary complex and inferior colliculus. In conclusion, our results suggest that early but transient deficits in the processing of auditory information on the level of the brainstem are present in Nrxn1α KO rats, which may contribute to later cortical auditory processing deficits observed in adulthood. Our study emphasizes the value of ABRs as a functional readout of auditory brainstem circuit function with potential value as a translational biomarker.

Exploring White Matter Microstructure with Symptom Severity and Outcomes Following Deep Brain Stimulation in Tremor Syndromes.	BACKGROUND: Essential tremor (ET) and dystonic tremor (DT) are movement disorders that cause debilitating symptoms, significantly impacting daily activities and quality of life. A poor understanding of their pathophysiology, as well as the mediators of clinical outcomes following deep brain stimulation (DBS), highlights the need for biomarkers to accurately characterise and optimally treat patients. OBJECTIVES: We assessed the white matter microstructure of pathways implicated in the pathophysiology and therapeutic intervention in a retrospective cohort of patients with DT (n = 17) and ET (n = 19). We aimed to identity associations between white matter microstructure, upper limb tremor severity, and tremor improvement following DBS. METHODS: A fixel-based analysis pipeline was implemented to investigate white matter microstructural metrics in the whole brain, cerebello-thalamic pathways and tracts connected to stimulation volumes following DBS. Associations with preoperative and postoperative severity were analysed within each disorder group and across combined disorder groups. RESULTS: DBS led to significant improvements in both groups. No group differences in stimulation positions were identified. When white matter microstructural data was aligned according to the maximally affected upper limb, increased fiber density, and combined fiber density & cross-section of fixels in the left cerebellum were associated with greater tremor severity across DT and ET patients. White matter microstructure did not show associations with postoperative changes in cerebello-thalamic pathways, or tracts connected to stimulation volumes. DISCUSSION: Diffusion changes of the cerebellum are associated with the severity of upper limb tremor and appear to overlap in essential or dystonic tremor disorders.	deep brain stimulation; dystonic tremor; essential tremor; fixel-based analysis

Persisting gaps in dementia carer wellbeing and education: A qualitative exploration of dementia carer experiences.	AIMS: To explore the emotional wellbeing of dementia carers in the lead up to and during transition of a person living with dementia to a residential aged care facility. DESIGN: An interpretative qualitative study. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with informal carers of person living with dementia between February and June 2023. Data were analysed using an inductive thematic approach and resulted in three themes. RESULTS: The majority of carers were adult children (n = 19) and six were wives. Carers lived across metropolitan (n = 20) and regional settings (n = 5) in the most populous state of Australia. Three themes were identified which were attributed to different aspects of the carer role: (1) Carer emotional journey as dementia progresses - impacted by knowledge and lack of support; (2) Questioning decision making-underpinned by knowledge and confidence; and (3) Challenges in re-establishing identity - impacted by ongoing concerns. CONCLUSION: As dementia progresses carers of person living with dementia consistently reported gaps in knowledge including how to access support. Specifically, this study identified the need for more to be done to help carers to develop the skills needed for their role, including participation in care planning and identifying care preferences for the future. Nurses can play a key role in promoting referral to services that support carers. Findings offer practical solutions to ameliorate carer stress and promote shared decision making. REPORTING METHOD: This research was guided by the Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research.	assessment; caregiver burden; dementia care; long‐term care facilities; nursing; qualitative approach

Impact of an improved outdoor space on people with dementia in a hospital unit.	INTRODUCTION: Gardens and outdoor spaces are an important part of institutional environments for people with dementia. However, evidence regarding the benefits these spaces have for people with dementia is still limited. This paper presents the evaluation of the redevelopment of an inaccessible outdoor space into a therapeutic garden on a high dependency psychogeriatric unit in an acute hospital. METHOD: A Mixed methods evaluation was undertaken. An interrupted time series analysis investigated the impact of the garden on falls and challenging behaviours of patients using routinely collected data. Perspectives of the redeveloped garden were captured through (a) a staff survey and (b) semi-structured interviews with families of patients. RESULTS: Rates of falls and challenging behaviours dropped at the time of the garden opening but showed increasing rates each month both before and after the garden opened. Most staff believed that the garden provided benefits for patients however limited staff time and concerns over patient safety were barriers to use. Families identified four main themes related to garden use including: (1) being outside (2) occupation and identity, (3) being stimulating, and (4) barriers and facilitators. CONCLUSION: The garden was regarded positively by families and staff however, there were barriers that prevented it from being better utilised. Staff concerns over risk were not reflected in falls and challenging behaviour outcomes. Further research into how barriers to garden use may be overcome is justified.

A survey study of Alzheimer's stigma among Black adults: intersectionality of Black identity and biomarker diagnosis.	OBJECTIVE: We urgently need to understand Alzheimer's disease (AD) stigma among Black adults. Black communities bear a disproportionate burden of AD, and recent advances in early diagnosis using AD biomarkers may affect stigma associated with AD. The goal of our study is to characterize AD stigma within our cohort of self-identified Black participants and test how AD biomarker test results may affect this stigma. DESIGN: We surveyed a sample of 1,150 self-identified Black adults who were randomized to read a vignette describing a fictional person, who was described as either having a positive or negative biomarker test result. After reading the vignette, participants completed the modified RESULTS: Participants over age 65 had lower scores (lower stigma) on all 7 FS-ADS domains compared to those under 65: CONCLUSION: While older adults reported less AD stigma than younger adults, AD biomarker testing caused similarly high concerns about structural discrimination and negative severity attributions. Thus, use of AD biomarker diagnosis may increase AD stigma and exacerbate healthcare disparities known to effect AD diagnosis in some Black adults. Advances in AD diagnosis may interact with social and structural factors to differentially affect groups of Black adults.

Each one, teach one: Critical history as counterstories, antiracist affordances, and cues for belonging.	Recently, there have been several calls for psychologists to dismantle systemic racism within the field (e.g., Buchanan et al., 2021; Dupree & Boykin, 2021; Wilcox et al., 2022). In this article, we discuss why incorporating critical histories into psychology curricula can be beneficial to this effort. We focus on three potential pathways: critical histories provide counterstories that challenge racist narratives, critical histories promote contexts that encourage antiracism practices (antiracist affordances), and critical histories can signal identity safety and belonging. To adequately integrate critical histories into psychology curricula, we make three recommendations. First, create and support a departmental curriculum that engages critical histories in the field of psychology at the undergraduate and graduate level (we offer some example topics and readings). Second, based on our own training experiences, we recommend that psychology graduate programs facilitate opportunities to take interdisciplinary courses that cover the history of race and racism in domestic and/or global contexts. Finally, we recommend funding research and supporting student projects that produce critical histories in psychology to expand the knowledge base of our field.

Decentralising the Self - Ethical Considerations in Utilizing Decentralised Web Technology for Direct Brain Interfaces.	The rapidly advancing field of brain-computer (BCI) and brain-to-brain interfaces (BBI) is stimulating interest across various sectors including medicine, entertainment, research, and military. The developers of large-scale brain-computer networks, sometimes dubbed 'Mindplexes' or 'Cloudminds', aim to enhance cognitive functions by distributing them across expansive networks. A key technical challenge is the efficient transmission and storage of information. One proposed solution is employing blockchain technology over Web 3.0 to create decentralised cognitive entities. This paper explores the potential of a decentralised web for coordinating large brain-computer constellations, and its associated benefits, focusing in particular on the conceptual and ethical challenges this innovation may pose pertaining to (1) Identity, (2) Sovereignty (encompassing Autonomy, Authenticity, and Ownership), (3) Responsibility and Accountability, and (4) Privacy, Safety, and Security. We suggest that while a decentralised web can address some concerns and mitigate certain risks, underlying ethical issues persist. Fundamental questions about entity definition within these networks, the distinctions between individuals and collectives, and responsibility distribution within and between networks, demand further exploration.

Metacognitive Awareness of Older Adult Drivers with Mild Cognitive Impairment: Relationships with Demographics, Subjective Evaluation of Cognition, and Driving Self-Efficacy.	(1) Self-regulation of driving is a means of maintaining one's driving identity. The purpose of this study was to investigate the extent to which older drivers with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) are metacognitively aware of the requirements of specific demanding driving conditions and whether this awareness is linked to subjective assessments of cognition. (2) One hundred seventeen (117) older MCI drivers participated in a telephone survey in which they reported their metacognitive experiences in nine driving conditions, listed as an aim of self-regulation. The analyses included the participants' subjective cognitive assessments, both in terms of their cognitive state and their perceived driving self-efficacy. (3) The analyses pointed out a direct and negative effect of age on the formation of the metacognitive feeling of certainty. Furthermore, an indirect effect of sex through driving self-efficacy was established. This effect was negative in the case of the metacognitive feeling of difficulty and the estimation of effort and positive in the case of the metacognitive feeling of certainty. (4) This position points out the need to establish appropriate levels of the perceived self-efficacy of older drivers with MCI, and it raises issues when it moves to fictitious levels.	driving; metacognitive experiences; mild cognitive impairment; self-regulation

Future-proofing genomic data and consent management: a comprehensive review of technology innovations.	Genomic information is increasingly used to inform medical treatments and manage future disease risks. However, any personal and societal gains must be carefully balanced against the risk to individuals contributing their genomic data. Expanding our understanding of actionable genomic insights requires researchers to access large global datasets to capture the complexity of genomic contribution to diseases. Similarly, clinicians need efficient access to a patient's genome as well as population-representative historical records for evidence-based decisions. Both researchers and clinicians hence rely on participants to consent to the use of their genomic data, which in turn requires trust in the professional and ethical handling of this information. Here, we review existing and emerging solutions for secure and effective genomic information management, including storage, encryption, consent, and authorization that are needed to build participant trust. We discuss recent innovations in cloud computing, quantum-computing-proof encryption, and self-sovereign identity. These innovations can augment key developments from within the genomics community, notably GA4GH Passports and the Crypt4GH file container standard. We also explore how decentralized storage as well as the digital consenting process can offer culturally acceptable processes to encourage data contributions from ethnic minorities. We conclude that the individual and their right for self-determination needs to be put at the center of any genomics framework, because only on an individual level can the received benefits be accurately balanced against the risk of exposing private information.	decentralized systems; dynamic consent; genome data privacy; self-sovereign identity; trust model

Overcoming resistance to belief revision and correction of misinformation beliefs: psychophysiological and behavioral effects of a counterfactual mindset.	In a series of experiments involving beliefs and misinformation beliefs, we find that individuals who are prompted with a counterfactual mindset are significantly more likely to change their existing beliefs when presented with evidence that contradicts their beliefs. While research finds that beliefs that are considered part of one's identity are highly resistant to change in the face of evidence that challenges these beliefs, four experiments provide evidence that counterfactual generation causes individuals to adjust beliefs and correct misinformation beliefs in response to contradicting evidence. Indeed, we find that a counterfactual mindset was effective in promoting incorporation of accurate facts and causing individuals to revise misinformation beliefs about COVID vaccination safety for a large sample of individuals who have rejected COVID vaccinations. Finally, the results of the psychophysiological experiment reveal that counterfactual generation alters decision makers' search strategies, increases their cognitive arousal in response to evidence that challenges their beliefs, and increases their desire to seek out disconfirming evidence. Overall, the four experiments indicate that counterfactual generation can effectively activate mindsets that increase individuals' willingness to evaluate evidence that contradicts their beliefs and adjust their beliefs in response to evidence.

Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is diagnosed in 10-30% of patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), and the frequency of MDD among individuals with BPD reaches over 80%. The comorbidity of MDD and BPD is associated with more severe depressive symptoms and functional impairment, higher risk of treatment resistance and increased suicidality. The effectiveness of ketamine usage in treatment resistant depression (TRD) has been demonstrated in numerous studies. In most of these studies, individuals with BPD were not excluded, thus given the high co-occurrence of these disorders, it is possible that the beneficial effects of ketamine also extend to the subpopulation with comorbid TRD and BPD. However, no protocols were developed that would account for comorbidity. Moreover, psychotherapeutic interventions, which may be crucial for achieving a lasting therapeutic effect in TRD and BPD comorbidity, were not included. In the article, we discuss the results of a small number of existing studies and case reports on the use of ketamine in depressive disorders with comorbid BPD. We elucidate how, at the molecular and brain network levels, ketamine can impact the neurobiology and symptoms of BPD. Furthermore, we explore whether ketamine-induced neuroplasticity, augmented by psychotherapy, could be of use in alleviating core BPD-related symptoms such as emotional dysregulation, self-identity disturbances and self-harming behaviors. We also discuss the potential of ketamine-assisted psychotherapy (KAP) in BPD treatment. As there is no standard approach to the application of ketamine or KAP in individuals with comorbid TRD and BPD, we consider further research in the field as imperative. The priorities should include development of dedicated protocols, distinguishing subpopulations that may benefit most from such treatment and investigating factors that may influence its effectiveness and safety.	borderline personality disorder; depression; esketamine; ketamine; ketamine-assisted psychotherapy (KAT); treatment resistant depression (TRD)

In recent years, brainprint recognition has emerged as a novel method of personal identity verification. Although studies have demonstrated the feasibility of this technology, some limitations hinder its further development into the society, such as insufficient efficiency (extended wear time for multi-channel EEG cap), complex experimental paradigms (more time in learning and completing experiments), and unclear neurobiological characteristics (lack of intuitive biomarkers and an inability to eliminate the impact of noise on individual differences). Overall, these limitations are due to the incomplete understanding of the underlying neural mechanisms. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the neural mechanisms behind brainwave recognition and simplify the operation process. We recorded prefrontal resting-state EEG data from 40 participants, which is followed up over nine months using a single-channel portable brainwave device. We found that portable devices can effectively and stably capture the characteristics of different subjects in the alpha band (8-13Hz) over long periods, as well as capturing their individual differences (no alpha peak, 1 alpha peak, or 2 alpha peaks). Through correlation analysis, alpha-band activity can reveal the uniqueness of the subjects compared to others within one minute. We further used a descriptive model to dissect the oscillatory and non-oscillatory components in the alpha band, demonstrating the different contributions of fine oscillatory features to individual differences (especially amplitude and bandwidth). Our study validated the feasibility of portable brainwave devices in brainwave recognition and the underlying neural oscillation mechanisms. The fine characteristics of various alpha oscillations will contribute to the accuracy of brainwave recognition, providing new insights for the development of future brainwave recognition technology.

Astrocytes are in constant communication with neurons during the establishment and maturation of functional networks in the developing brain. Astrocytes release extracellular vesicles (EVs) containing microRNA (miRNA) cargo that regulates transcript stability in recipient cells. Astrocyte released factors are thought to be involved in neurodevelopmental disorders. Healthy astrocytes partially rescue Rett Syndrome (RTT) neuron function. EVs isolated from stem cell progeny also correct aspects of RTT. EVs cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and their cargo is found in peripheral blood which may allow non-invasive detection of EV cargo as biomarkers produced by healthy astrocytes. Here we characterize miRNA cargo and sequence motifs in healthy human astrocyte derived EVs (ADEVs). First, human induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (iPSC) were differentiated into Neural Progenitor Cells (NPCs) and subsequently into astrocytes using a rapid differentiation protocol. iPSC derived astrocytes expressed specific markers, displayed intracellular calcium transients and secreted ADEVs. miRNAs were identified by RNA-Seq on astrocytes and ADEVs and target gene pathway analysis detected brain and immune related terms. The miRNA profile was consistent with astrocyte identity, and included approximately 80 miRNAs found in astrocytes that were relatively depleted in ADEVs suggestive of passive loading. About 120 miRNAs were relatively enriched in ADEVs and motif analysis discovered binding sites for RNA binding proteins FUS, SRSF7 and CELF5. miR-483-5p was the most significantly enriched in ADEVs. This miRNA regulates MECP2 expression in neurons and has been found differentially expressed in blood samples from RTT patients. Our results identify potential miRNA biomarkers selectively sorted into ADEVs and implicate RNA binding protein sequence dependent mechanisms for miRNA cargo loading.

BRG1 programs PRC2-complex repression and controls oligodendrocyte differentiation and remyelination.	Chromatin-remodeling protein BRG1/SMARCA4 is pivotal for establishing oligodendrocyte (OL) lineage identity. However, its functions for oligodendrocyte-precursor cell (OPC) differentiation within the postnatal brain and during remyelination remain elusive. Here, we demonstrate that Brg1 loss profoundly impairs OPC differentiation in the brain with a comparatively lesser effect in the spinal cord. Moreover, BRG1 is critical for OPC remyelination after injury. Integrative transcriptomic/genomic profiling reveals that BRG1 exhibits a dual role by promoting OPC differentiation networks while repressing OL-inhibitory cues and proneuronal programs. Furthermore, we find that BRG1 interacts with EED/PRC2 polycomb-repressive-complexes to enhance H3K27me3-mediated repression at gene loci associated with OL-differentiation inhibition and neurogenesis. Notably, BRG1 depletion decreases H3K27me3 deposition, leading to the upregulation of BMP/WNT signaling and proneurogenic genes, which suppresses OL programs. Thus, our findings reveal a hitherto unexplored spatiotemporal-specific role of BRG1 for OPC differentiation in the developing CNS and underscore a new insight into BRG1/PRC2-mediated epigenetic regulation that promotes and safeguards OL lineage commitment and differentiation.

[Postnatal epigenome-mediated aging control and global trends].	The epigenome can adequately regulate the on/off states of genes in response to external environmental factors and stress. In recent years, it has been observed that the epigenome, which is modulated through DNA methylation, histone modifications, and chromatin remodeling, changes with age. Alterations in the epigenome lead to the loss of cell-specific epigenome/identity, which in turn triggers a decline in tissue function. In mammals, postnatal epigenomic variations are not only caused by metabolic diseases, such as diabetes or DNA damage, but also by social stress and infectious diseases. Unlike Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS), dynamically changing epigenomes, along with their cellular roles, need to be established as objective biomarkers in conjunction with various biological signals, such as walking speed, brain waves, and clinical data. The biological age/aging clock, determined by methylated DNA, has attracted attention, and calorie restriction not only slows the progression of aging, but also seems to suppress it. However, as indicated by gene expression analysis in aging mice, aging is not a linear model, but is represented by nonlinear dynamic changes. Consequently, the development of experimental models and analytical methods that enhance temporal resolution through time-series analysis, tailored to spatial resolution, such as cell distribution and organ specificity, is progressing. Moreover, in recent years, in addition to anti-aging efforts targeting epigenomic variations, global attention has increasingly focused on research and development aimed at rejuvenating treatments, thus leading to the birth of many biotech companies. Aging Hallmarks such as inflammation, stem cells, metabolism, genomic instability, and autophagy, interact closely with the epigenome. Various postnatal and reversible epigenomic controls of aging, including Yamanaka factors (OKSM and OSK), are now entering a new phase. In the future, the development of aging control using diverse modalities, such as mRNA, artificial peptides, and genome editing, is expected, along with an improved molecular understanding of aging and identification of useful biomarkers.

High throughput screening of mesenchymal stromal cell morphological response to inflammatory signals for bioreactor-based manufacturing of extracellular vesicles that modulate microglia.	Due to their immunomodulatory function, mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are a promising therapeutic with the potential to treat neuroinflammation associated with neurodegenerative diseases. This function is mediated by secreted extracellular vesicles (MSC-EVs). Despite established safety, MSC clinical translation has been unsuccessful due to inconsistent clinical outcomes resulting from functional heterogeneity. Current approaches to mitigate functional heterogeneity include 'priming' MSCs with inflammatory signals to enhance function. However, comprehensive evaluation of priming and its effects on MSC-EV function has not been performed. Furthermore, clinical translation of MSC-EV therapies requires significant manufacturing scale-up, yet few studies have investigated the effects of priming in bioreactors. As MSC morphology has been shown to predict their immunomodulatory function, we screened MSC morphological response to an array of priming signals and evaluated MSC-EV identity and potency in response to priming in flasks and bioreactors. We identified unique priming conditions corresponding to distinct morphologies. These conditions demonstrated a range of MSC-EV preparation quality and lipidome, allowing us to discover a novel MSC-EV manufacturing condition, as well as gain insight into potential mechanisms of MSC-EV microglia modulation. Our novel screening approach and application of priming to MSC-EV bioreactor manufacturing informs refinement of larger-scale manufacturing and enhancement of MSC-EV function.

"INFLAMMATION's cognitive impact revealed by a novel ""Line of Identity"" approach."	"IMPORTANCE: Dementia is an ""overdetermined"" syndrome. Few individuals are demented by any single biomarker, while several may independently explain small fractions of dementia severity. It may be advantageous to identify individuals afflicted by a specific biomarker to guide individualized treatment. OBJECTIVE: We aim to validate a psychometric classifier to identify persons adversely impacted by inflammation and replicate it in a second cohort. DESIGN: Secondary analyses of data collected by the Texas Alzheimer's Research and Care Consortium (TARCC) (N = 3497) and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) (N = 1737). SETTING: Two large, well-characterized multi-center convenience samples. PARTICIPANTS: Volunteers with normal cognition (NC), Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) or clinical ""Alzheimer's Disease (AD)"". EXPOSURE: Participants were assigned to ""Afflicted"" or ""Resilient"" classes on the basis of a psychometric classifier derived by confirmatory factor analysis. MAIN OUTCOME(S) AND MEASURE(S): The groups were contrasted on multiple assessments and biomarkers. The groups were also contrasted regarding 4-year prospective conversions to ""AD"" from non-demented baseline diagnoses (controls and MCI). The Afflicted groups were predicted to have adverse levels of inflammation-related blood-based biomarkers, greater dementia severity and greater risk of prospective conversion. RESULTS: In ADNI /plasma, 47.1% of subjects were assigned to the Afflicted class. 44.6% of TARCC's subjects were afflicted, 49.5% of non-Hispanic Whites (NHW) and 37.2% of Mexican Americans (MA). There was greater dementia severity in the Afflicted class [by ANOVA: ADNI /F(1) = 686.99, p <0.001; TARCC /F(1) = 1544.01, p <0.001]. ""INFLAMMATION"" factor composite scores were significantly higher (adverse) in Afflicted subjects [by ANOVA in ADNI /plasma F(1) = 1642.64, p <0.001 and in TARCC /serum F(1) = 3059.96, p <0.001]. Afflicted cases were more likely to convert to AD in the next four years [by Cox's F, ADNI /plasma: F (252, 268) = 3.74 p < 0.001; TARCC /serum: F (160, 134) = 3.03, p < 0.001 (in TARCC's entire sample), F (110, 90) = 4.92, p <0.001 in NHW, and F(50, 44) = 2.13, p = 0.006 in MA]. The proportions converting were similar among afflicted NHW in both cohorts /biofluids but MA exhibited a lower risk (7% in TARCC /serum at 48 months). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Our inflammation-specific psychometric classifier selects individuals with pre-specified biomarker profiles and predicts conversion to ""AD"" across cohorts, biofluids, and ethnicities. This algorithm might be applied to any dementia-related biomarker making the psychometric estimation of individual biomarker effects feasible without biomarker assessment. Our approach also distinguishes individuals resilient to individual biomarker effects allowing for more accurate prediction and precision intervention."

Epigenetic control of microglial immune responses.	"Microglia, the major population of brain-resident macrophages, are now recognized as a heterogeneous population comprising several cell subtypes with different (so far mostly supposed) functions in health and disease. A number of studies have performed molecular characterization of these different microglial activation states over the last years making use of ""omics"" technologies, that is transcriptomics, proteomics and, less frequently, epigenomics profiling. These approaches offer the possibility to identify disease mechanisms, discover novel diagnostic biomarkers, and develop new therapeutic strategies. Here, we focus on epigenetic profiling as a means to understand microglial immune responses beyond what other omics methods can offer, that is, revealing past and present molecular responses, gene regulatory networks and potential future response trajectories, and defining cell subtype-specific disease relevance through mapping non-coding genetic variants. We review the current knowledge in the field regarding epigenetic regulation of microglial identity and function, provide an exemplary analysis that demonstrates the advantages of performing joint transcriptomic and epigenomic profiling of single microglial cells and discuss how comprehensive epigenetic analyses may enhance our understanding of microglial pathophysiology."

Age and gender differences in non-motor symptoms in people with Parkinson's disease.	BACKGROUND: Non-motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD) are highly prevalent and heterogenic. Previous studies aimed to gain more insight on this heterogeneity by investigating age and gender differences in non-motor symptom severity, but findings were inconsistent. Furthermore, besides examining the single effects of age and gender, the interaction between them in relation to non-motor functioning has -as far as we know- not been investigated before. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the association of age and gender identity -as well as the interaction between age and gender identity- with non-motor symptoms and their impact on quality of life. METHODS: We combined three large and independent studies. This approach resulted in a total number of unique participants of 1,509. We used linear regression models to assess the association of age and gender identity, and their interaction, with non-motor symptoms and their impact on quality of life. RESULTS: Older people with PD generally had worse cognitive functioning, worse autonomic functioning and worse quality of life. Women with PD generally experienced more anxiety, worse autonomic functioning and worse quality of life compared to men with PD, whereas men with PD generally had worse cognitive functioning. In interaction analyses by age and gender identity, depressive symptoms and anxiety were disproportionally worse with increasing age in women compared to men. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that both age and gender -as well as their interaction- are differentially associated with non-motor symptoms of PD. Both research and clinical practice should pay more attention to demographic subgroups differences and possible different treatment approaches with respect to age and gender. We showed how combining datasets is of added value in this kind of analyses and encourage others to use similar approaches.	Parkinson’s disease; age; gender; non-motor symptoms; quality of life

Cognitive, functional, and neuropsychiatric correlates of regional tau pathology in autopsy-confirmed chronic traumatic encephalopathy.	BACKGROUND: Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by hyperphosphorylated tau (p-tau) accumulation. The clinical features associated with CTE pathology are unclear. In brain donors with autopsy-confirmed CTE, we investigated the association of CTE p-tau pathology density and location with cognitive, functional, and neuropsychiatric symptoms. METHODS: In 364 brain donors with autopsy confirmed CTE, semi-quantitative p-tau severity (range: 0-3) was assessed in 10 cortical and subcortical regions. We summed ratings across regions to form a p-tau severity global composite (range: 0-30). Informants completed standardized scales of cognition (Cognitive Difficulties Scale, CDS; BRIEF-A Metacognition Index, MI), activities of daily living (Functional Activities Questionnaire), neurobehavioral dysregulation (BRIEF-A Behavioral Regulation Index, BRI; Barratt Impulsiveness Scale, BIS-11), aggression (Brown-Goodwin Aggression Scale), depression (Geriatric Depression Scale-15, GDS-15), and apathy (Apathy Evaluation Scale, AES). Ordinary least squares regression models examined associations between global and regional p-tau severity (separate models for each region) with each clinical scale, adjusting for age at death, racial identity, education level, and history of hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea, and substance use treatment. Ridge regression models that incorporated p-tau severity across all regions in the same model assessed which regions showed independent effects. RESULTS: The sample was predominantly American football players (333; 91.2%); 140 (38.5%) had low CTE and 224 (61.5%) had high CTE. Global p-tau severity was associated with higher (i.e., worse) scores on the cognitive and functional scales: MI ([Formula: see text] CONCLUSION: Accumulation of p-tau aggregates, especially in the frontal cortex, are associated with cognitive, functional, and certain neurobehavioral symptoms in CTE.

Differentiating Biomarker Features and Familial Characteristics of B-SNIP Psychosis Biotypes.	"Idiopathic psychosis shows considerable biological heterogeneity across cases. B-SNIP used psychosis-relevant biomarkers to identity psychosis Biotypes, which will aid etiological and targeted treatment investigations. Psychosis probands from the B-SNIP consortium (n = 1907), their first-degree biological relatives (n = 705), and healthy participants (n = 895) completed a biomarker battery composed of cognition, saccades, and auditory EEG measurements. ERP quantifications were substantially modified from previous iterations of this approach. Multivariate integration reduced multiple biomarker outcomes to 11 ""bio-factors"". Twenty-four different approaches indicated bio-factor data among probands were best distributed as three subgroups. Numerical taxonomy with k-means constructed psychosis Biotypes, and rand indices evaluated consistency of Biotype assignments. Psychosis subgroups, their non-psychotic first-degree relatives, and healthy individuals were compared across bio-factors. The three psychosis Biotypes differed significantly on all 11 bio-factors, especially prominent for general cognition, antisaccades, ERP magnitude, and intrinsic neural activity. Rand indices showed excellent consistency of clustering membership when samples included at least 1100 subjects. Canonical discriminant analysis described composite bio-factors that simplified group comparisons and captured neural dysregulation, neural vigor, and stimulus salience variates. Neural dysregulation captured Biotype-2, low neural vigor captured Biotype-1, and deviations of stimulus salience captured Biotype-3. First-degree relatives showed similar patterns as their Biotyped proband relatives on general cognition, antisaccades, ERP magnitudes, and intrinsic brain activity. Results extend previous efforts by the B-SNIP consortium to characterize biologically distinct psychosis Biotypes. They also show that at least 1100 observations are necessary to achieve consistent outcomes. First-degree relative data implicate specific bio-factor deviations to the subtype of their proband and may inform studies of genetic risk."

Occupational Therapy's Role in Return to Occupations Post-Concussion in High School Athletes.	AIM: This study was designed to explore experiences of high school athletes in order to understand their occupational engagement after sustaining a sports-related concussion. The study explored the role occupational therapists (OTs) can play in post-concussion care while supporting adolescents in returning to meaningful occupations. METHODS: The study utilized a qualitative, phenomenological approach by conducting interviews with high school athletes to understand their participation in occupations during recovery. Six student-athletes from 14-18 years of age were interviewed. RESULTS: The five identified themes from the study included impacts on ADL performance, school performance, sleep, mental health, and driver safety. Student-athletes reported feelings of loneliness and loss of identity. Dressing, showering, grooming, and driving were disturbed due to balance deficits, headaches, and nausea. Participants reported decreased participation in social, sports, and leisure occupations due to heightened symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Due to the considerable variability of disturbance in occupational participation post-concussion, occupational therapists can assist in creating and implementing individualized treatment plans to support high school athletes while recovering from a sports-related concussion.

Major stress in early childhood strengthens the association between peripheral inflammatory activity and corticostriatal responsivity to reward.	BACKGROUND: Severe, chronic stress during childhood accentuates vulnerability to mental and physical health problems across the lifespan. To explain this phenomenon, the neuroimmune network hypothesis proposes that childhood stressors amplify signaling between peripheral inflammatory cells and developing brain circuits that support processing of rewards and threats. Here, we conducted a preliminary test of the basic premises of this hypothesis. METHODS: 180 adolescents (mean age = 19.1 years; 68.9 % female) with diverse racial and ethnic identities (56.1 % White; 28.3 % Hispanic; 26.1 % Asian) participated. The Childhood Trauma Interview was administered to quantify early adversity. Five inflammatory biomarkers were assayed in antecubital blood - C-reactive protein, tumor necrosis factor-a, and interleukins-6, -8, and -10 - and were averaged to form a composite score. Participants also completed a functional MRI task to measure corticostriatal responsivity to the anticipation and acquisition of monetary rewards. RESULTS: Stress exposure and corticostriatal responsivity interacted statistically to predict the inflammation composite. Among participants who experienced major stressors in the first decade of life, higher inflammatory activity covaried with lower corticostriatal responsivity during acquisition of monetary rewards. This relationship was specific to participants who experienced major stress in early childhood, implying a sensitive period for exposure, and were evident in both the orbitofrontal cortex and the ventral striatum, suggesting the broad involvement of corticostriatal regions. The findings were independent of participants' age, sex, racial and ethnic identity, family income, and depressive symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, the results are consistent with hypotheses suggesting that major stress in childhood alters brain-immune signaling.

Dementia care and prevention in community settings: a built environment framework for cognitive health promotion.	"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Most people with dementia live in the community. As lifespan increases, one in three persons aged 85+ are expected to live with dementia. We conduct a systematic search to identify frameworks for dementia care and prevention in community settings. This is important to ensure quality of life for people living with cognitive decline (PLCD). RECENT FINDINGS: 61 frameworks are synthesized into the dementia care and prevention in community (DCPC) framework. It highlights three levels of provision: built environment and policy supports, access and innovation, and inclusion across stages of decline. Domains of intervention include: basic needs; built environment health and accessibility; service access and use; community health infrastructure; community engagement; mental health and wellbeing; technology; end-of-life care; cultural considerations; policy, education, and resources. Personhood is not adequately represented in current built environment frameworks. This is supplemented with 14 articles on lived experiences at home and social practices that contribute to PLCD's social identity and psychological safety. SUMMARY: Policy makers, health and built environment professionals must work together to promote ""personhood in community"" with PLCD. Clinicians and community staff may focus on inclusion, social identity and a sense of at-homeness as attainable outcomes despite diagnosis."

Participant completion of longitudinal assessments in an online cognitive aging registry: The role of medical conditions.	INTRODUCTION: This study aimed to understand whether older adults' longitudinal completion of assessments in an online Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD)-related registry is influenced by self-reported medical conditions. METHODS: Brain Health Registry (BHR) is an online cognitive aging and ADRD-related research registry that includes longitudinal health and cognitive assessments. Using logistic regressions, we examined associations between longitudinal registry completion outcomes and self-reported (1) number of medical conditions and (2) eight defined medical condition groups (cardiovascular, metabolic, immune system, ADRD, current psychiatric, substance use/abuse, acquired, other specified conditions) in adults aged 55+ ( RESULTS: We found that the likelihood of longitudinally completing the initial questionnaire was negatively associated with reporting a diagnosis of ADRD and current psychiatric conditions but was positively associated with reporting substance use/abuse and acquired medical conditions. The likelihood of longitudinally completing the cognitive assessment task was negatively associated with number of reported medical conditions, as well as with reporting cardiovascular conditions, ADRD, and current psychiatric conditions. Previously identified associations between ethnocultural identity and longitudinal assessment completion in BHR remained after accounting for the presence of medical conditions. DISCUSSION: This post hoc analysis provides novel, initial evidence that older adults' completion of longitudinal assessments in an online registry is associated with the number and types of participant-reported medical conditions. Our findings can inform future efforts to make online studies with longitudinal health and cognitive assessments more usable for older adults with medical conditions. The results need to be interpreted with caution due to selection biases, and the under-inclusion of minoritized communities.

An intersectional analysis of long COVID prevalence.	BACKGROUND: Long COVID symptoms - which include brain fog, depression, and fatigue - are mild at best and debilitating at worst. Some U.S. health surveys have found that women, lower income individuals, and those with less education are overrepresented among adults with long COVID, but these studies do not address intersectionality. To fill this gap, we conduct an intersectional analysis of the prevalence and outcomes of long COVID in the U.S. We posit that disparities in long COVID have less to do with the virus itself and more to do with social determinants of health, especially those associated with occupational segregation and the gendered division of household work. METHODS: We use 10 rounds of Household Pulse Survey (HPS) data collected between June 2022 and March 2023 to perform an intersectional analysis using a battery of descriptive statistics that evaluate (1) the prevalence of long COVID and (2) the interference of long COVID symptoms with day-to-day activities. We also use the HPS data to estimate a set of multivariate logistic regressions that relate the odds of having long COVID and activity limitations due to long COVID to a set of individual characteristics as well as intersections by sex, race/ethnicity, education, and sexual orientation and gender identity. RESULTS: Findings indicate that women, some people of color, sexual and gender minorities, and people without college degrees are more likely to have long COVID and to have activity limitations from long COVID. Women have considerably higher odds of developing long COVID compared to men, a disparity exacerbated by having less education. Intersectional analysis by gender, race, ethnicity, and education reveals a striking step-like pattern: college-educated men have the lowest prevalence of long COVID while women without college educations have the highest prevalence. Daily activity limitations are more evenly distributed across demographics, but a different step-like pattern is present: fewer women with degrees have activity limitations while limitations are more widespread among men without degrees. Regression results confirm the negative association of long COVID with being a woman, less educated, Hispanic, and a sexual and gender minority, while results for the intersectional effects are more nuanced. CONCLUSIONS: Results point to systematic disparities in health, highlighting the urgent need for policies that increase access to quality healthcare, strengthen the social safety net, and reduce economic precarity.

High throughput screening of mesenchymal stromal cell morphological response to inflammatory signals for bioreactor-based manufacturing of extracellular vesicles that modulate microglia.	Due to their immunomodulatory function, mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are a promising therapeutic with the potential to treat neuroinflammation associated with neurodegenerative diseases. This function can be mediated by secreted extracellular vesicles (MSC-EVs). Despite established safety, MSC clinical translation has been unsuccessful due to inconsistent clinical outcomes resulting from functional heterogeneity. Current approaches to mitigate functional heterogeneity include 'priming' MSCs with inflammatory signals to enhance function. However, comprehensive evaluation of priming and its effects on MSC-EV function has not been performed. Clinical translation of MSC-EV therapies requires significant manufacturing scale-up, yet few studies have investigated the effects of priming in bioreactors. As MSC morphology has been shown to predict their immunomodulatory function, we screened MSC morphological response to an array of priming signals and evaluated MSC-EV identity and potency in response to priming in flasks and bioreactors. We identified unique priming conditions corresponding to distinct morphologies. These conditions demonstrated a range of MSC-EV preparation quality and lipidome, allowing us to discover a novel MSC-EV manufacturing condition, as well as gain insight into potential mechanisms of MSC-EV microglia modulation. Our novel screening approach and application of priming to MSC-EV bioreactor manufacturing informs refinement of larger-scale manufacturing and enhancement of MSC-EV function.

BACKGROUND: Blood biomarkers can improve the ability to diagnose dementia, providing new information to better understand the pathophysiology and causes of the disease. Some studies with patients have already shown changes in metabolic profiles among patients with pathological cognitive decline or Alzheimer's disease, when compared to individuals with normal cognition. METHODS: To search for new metabolic biomarkers of dementia, we analyzed serum levels of several metabolites, measured by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, in elderly individuals, a group with normal cognitive decline (control), and three other groups with cognitive decline. pathological (low, moderate, and severe). RESULTS: Decreased plasma levels of tyrosine, glutamate, valine, leucine, and isoleucine are associated with worsening of pathological cognitive decline. However, the area under analysis of receptor operating characteristics suggests that tyrosine and glutamate have low specificity and sensitivity. Valine, leucine, and isoleucine are influenced by blood glucose or diabetes, but these conditions do not seem to be of great influence in the differences observed. Isobutyrate, histidine, acetone and unknown-1 metabolite also decrease their plasma levels with increasing CD. Isobutyrate ad histidine could have neuroprotective and antioxidant actions, respectively. To elucidate the role of decreased unknown metabolite-1 as a CD biomarker, it will be necessary to previously investigate its identity. To define and elucidate the role of acetone in pathological CD, additional laboratory and clinical studies must be performed. All these metabolites together may constitute a set of biomarkers with capability to identify pathological CD or dementia. SIGNIFICANCE AND NOVELTY: Decrease of glutamate, tyrosine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, histidine, isobutyrate, acetone and unknown-1 metabolite together are a set of biomarkers able to identify pathological CD or dementia. Histidine, isobutyrate, acetone and unknown-1 metabolite are more specific biomarkers of CD.	Cognitive decline; Dementia; Metabolic markers; Plasma

Experience of rehabilitation specialist nurses in providing bowel care for stroke patients: A qualitative study.	AIMS: This study aims to explore the experiences of rehabilitation specialist nurses in providing bowel care to stroke patients and to identify the factors that either facilitate or hinder their practice. DESIGN: This was a descriptive qualitative design study. METHODS: Between May 2022 and October 2022, we conducted in-depth and semi-structured interviews with 12 rehabilitation specialist nurses from two tertiary hospitals in Changsha, China. Thematic analysis was employed to analyse the interview transcripts. FINDINGS: Three key themes were revealed from our analysis: (1) acceptance of bowel care as a process, (2) high level of recognition improves the experience and (3) challenges stemming from limited knowledge and rights. Acceptance of bowel care as a dynamic process, coupled with a high level of recognition, enabled nurses to prioritize the health and safety of patients over personal feelings and achieve professional accomplishments. However, they encountered challenges in terms of professional development and restricted prescribing rights for bowel care. CONCLUSION: The experiences of rehabilitation specialist nurses in providing bowel care are dynamic. These findings have important implications for healthcare improvement, including the need for collaboration with healthcare professionals and nurturing nurses' self-identity, comprehensive training plans, innovative programs and expanding the scope of rehabilitation specialist nurses' rights. IMPACT: This study enhances our understanding of the challenges faced by rehabilitation specialist nurses caring for stroke patients with neurogenic bowel dysfunction. The findings provide insights into how to enhance bowel care experience and develop further in this field. REPORTING METHOD: This study adhered to the EQUATOR guideline and utilized the COREQ checklist. PATIENT OR PUBLIC CONTRIBUTIONS: This study involved participants who were registered nurses, and there were no contributions from patients or public.	neurogenic bowel dysfunction; nursing; stroke; thematic analysis

Synaptic proteins in neuron-derived extracellular vesicles as biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease: novel methodology and clinical proof of concept.	AIMS: Blood biomarkers can improve drug development for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its treatment. Neuron-derived extracellular vesicles (NDEVs) in plasma offer a minimally invasive platform for developing novel biomarkers that may be used to monitor the diverse pathogenic processes involved in AD. However, NDEVs comprise only a minor fraction of circulating extracellular vesicles (EVs). Most published studies have leveraged the L1 cell adhesion molecule (L1CAM) for NDEV immunocapture. We aimed to develop and optimize an alternative, highly specific immunoaffinity method to enrich blood NDEVs for biomarker development. METHODS: After screening multiple neuronal antigens, we achieved NDEV capture with high affinity and specificity using antibodies against Growth-Associated Protein (GAP) 43 and Neuroligin 3 (NLGN3). The EV identity of the captured material was confirmed by electron microscopy, western blotting, and proteomics. The specificity for neuronal origin was demonstrated by showing enrichment for neuronal markers (proteins, mRNA) and recovery of spiked neuronal EVs. We performed NDEV isolation retrospectively from plasma samples from two cohorts of early AD patients (N = 19 and N = 40) and controls (N = 20 and N = 19) and measured p181-Tau, amyloid-beta (Aβ) 42, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), precursor brain-derived neurotrophic factor (proBDNF), glutamate receptor 2 (GluR2), postsynaptic density protein (PSD) 95, GAP43, and syntaxin-1. RESULTS: p181-Tau, Aβ42, and NRGN were elevated in AD samples, whereas proBDNF, GluR2, PSD95, GAP43, and Syntaxin-1 were reduced. Differences for p181-Tau, proBDNF, and GluR2 survived multiple-comparison correction and were correlated with cognitive scores. A model incorporating biomarkers correctly classified 94.7% of AD participants and 61.5% of control participants. The observed differences in NDEVs-associated biomarkers are consistent with previous findings. CONCLUSION: NDEV isolation by GAP43 and NLGN3 immunocapture offers a robust novel platform for biomarker development in AD, suitable for large-scale validation.

Anticipated Psychological or Behavioral Reactions to Learning Alzheimer Biomarker Results: Associations With Contextual Factors.	BACKGROUND: As Alzheimer disease (AD) biomarker testing becomes more widely available, adults may opt to learn results. Considering potential reactions to learning biomarker results can guide prebiomarker and postbiomarker testing education and counseling programs. METHODS: Cognitively healthy adults enrolled in observational Alzheimer research responded to a telephone survey about learning AD risk information (n=334; 44% Black or African American; mean age=64.9±7.0). Multiple linear regression models tested if contextual factors predicted anticipated psychological impact (distress, stigma, and cognitive symptoms) or behavior change (planning and risk-reduction). Secondary analyses tested for differences in relationships by racial identity. RESULTS: Internal health locus of control, concern about AD, self-identified sex, education, family dementia history, and belief in AD modifiability predicted anticipated psychological impact. Concern about AD, age, racial identity, belief in AD modifiability, research attitudes, and exposure to brain health-related social norms predicted anticipated behavior change. For Black respondents, there were no sex differences in anticipated distress, whereas there were stronger relationships between health locus of control, brain health social norms, and education on outcomes compared with White respondents. CONCLUSIONS: Results may inform personalized and culturally tailored biomarker testing education and counseling to minimize psychological impacts and increase behavior change related to learning AD risk information.

Antipsychotic dose reduction and discontinuation versus maintenance treatment in people with schizophrenia and other recurrent psychotic disorders in England (the RADAR trial): an open, parallel-group, randomised controlled trial.	BACKGROUND: Maintenance antipsychotic medication is recommended for people with schizophrenia or recurrent psychosis, but the adverse effects are burdensome, and evidence on long-term outcomes is sparse. We aimed to assess the benefits and harms of a gradual process of antipsychotic reduction compared with maintenance treatment. Our hypothesis was that antipsychotic reduction would improve social functioning with a short-term increase in relapse. METHODS: RADAR was an open, parallel-group, randomised trial done in 19 National Health Service Trusts in England. Participants were aged 18 years and older, had a diagnosis of recurrent, non-affective psychotic disorder, and were prescribed an antipsychotic. Exclusion criteria included people who had a mental health crisis or hospital admission in the past month, were considered to pose a serious risk to themselves or others by a treating clinician, or were mandated to take antipsychotic medication under the Mental Health Act. Through an independent, internet-based system, participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to gradual, flexible antipsychotic reduction, overseen by treating clinicians, or to maintenance. Participants and clinicians were aware of treatment allocations, but assessors were masked to them. Follow-up was for 2 years. Social functioning, assessed by the Social Functioning Scale, was the primary outcome. The principal secondary outcome was severe relapse, defined as requiring admission to hospital. Analysis was done blind to group identity using intention-to-treat data. The trial is completed and has been registered with ISRCTN registry (ISRCTN90298520) and with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03559426). FINDINGS: 4157 people were screened, of whom 253 were randomly allocated, including 168 (66%) men, 82 (32%) women, and 3 (1%) transgender people, with a mean age of 46 years (SD 12, range 22-79). 171 (67%) participants were White, 52 (21%) were Black, 16 (6%) were Asian, and 12 (5%) were of other ethnicity. The median dose reduction at any point during the trial was 67% in the reduction group and zero in the maintenance group; at 24 months it was 33% versus zero. At the 24-month follow-up, we assessed 90 of 126 people assigned to the antipsychotic dose reduction group and 94 of 127 assigned to the maintenance group, finding no difference in the Social Functioning Scale (β 0·19, 95% CI -1·94 to 2·33; p=0·86). There were 93 serious adverse events in the reduction group affecting 49 individuals, mainly comprising admission for a mental health relapse, and 64 in the maintenance group, relating to 29 individuals. INTERPRETATION: At 2-year follow-up, a gradual, supported process of antipsychotic dose reduction had no effect on social functioning. Our data can help to inform decisions about the use of long-term antipsychotic medication. FUNDING: National Institute for Health Research.

Late life depression and concepts of aging: an emerging paradigm.	Late life depression (LLD) is an emerging challenge, and recognized as a significant barrier to long-term healthy aging. Viewed within the context of the medical/biological model, advances in brain sciences over the last several decades have led to a deeper understanding of the biology of LLD. These advances in current knowledge include the description of aging brain pathophysiology; the biology and biochemistry of neurotransmitters; the correspondence between changes in neurological structure, function, and neural network; the description of neural, hormonal and inflammatory biomarkers; and identification of typical phenotypic subtypes of LLD. Despite these advances, current treatment of LLD, which remains largely pharmacological with accompanying cognitive and behavioral interventions, has poor success rate for long-term remission among older people. A wider perspective, in keeping with several emerging aging concepts, is suggested as an alternative framework within which to view LLD. A growing body of research supports the important role in LLD of frailty, resilience, intrinsic capacity, and functional integrity. Similarly, important social determinants need to be addressed in the etiology of LLD, rooted largely in negative stereotypes of aging, with consequent repercussions of reduced participation and inclusion, growing social isolation, with loss of identity, meaning and hope. This perspective suggests the importance of a wider integrative conceptualization of depression, set against a background of emerging aging concepts.	aging models; brain aging; intrinsic capacity; late life depression; resilience

"""I Want to Know Everything ... "": The Return of Research Results and the Importance of Transparency in the Acceptability of Lumbar Punctures for African American Older Adults."	"BACKGROUND: Although African Americans experience the highest risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD), they are dramatically underrepresented in preclinical biomarker research. This is especially true for studies involving lumbar puncture as it may involve more perceived risk even for those participants who are otherwise supportive of research. OBJECTIVE: To understand the unique concerns of African American participants regarding biomarker studies involving lumbar puncture who demonstrate support for AD research. METHODS: Study participants were African American adults contacted through an AD research registry. We employed a novel method used to create hypothetical research studies varying on a set number of factors. The method is designed to collect potential patterns in decision making regarding research participation but differs from experimental vignette design in that the survey is administered with an accompanying qualitive interview to determine the meaning participants ascribe to factors independently and in conjunction with one another. RESULTS: Sixty-one participants each reviewed three randomly selected research scenarios and created their ""ideal"" study involving lumbar puncture. Scenario variables included: disclosure of research results, racial and ethnic identity of the researcher, recruitment method, and amount of incentive. CONCLUSION: Findings indicate that transparency in the return of AD research results to be the strongest driver of participation, followed by race of the researcher and amount of incentive. Recruitment method had limited impact on hypothetical decision making."	Alzheimer’s disease; Black or African American; ethics; health; health equity

Cholesterol modulates the physiological response to nanoparticles by changing the composition of protein corona.	Nanoparticles (NPs) in biological fluids form a layer of biomolecules known as the protein corona. The protein corona has been shown to determine the biological identity and in vivo fate of NPs, but whether and how metabolites, especially disease-related small molecules, regulate the protein corona and subsequently impact NP fate in vivo is relatively poorly understood. Here we report on the effects of cholesterol on the generation of protein corona and subsequent effects. We find that high levels of cholesterol, as in hypercholesterolemia, result in a protein corona with enriched apolipoproteins and reduced complement proteins by altering the binding affinity of the proteins to the NPs. The cholesterol-mediated protein corona can induce stronger inflammatory responses to NPs in macrophages and promote the cellular uptake of NPs in hepatocytes by enhancing the recognition of lipoprotein receptors when compared with normal protein corona. The result of in vivo biodistribution assays shows that, compared with healthy mice, NPs in hypercholesterolemic mice were more likely to be delivered to the liver, spleen and brain, and less likely to be delivered to the lungs. Our findings reveal that the metabolome profile is an unexploited factor impacting the target efficacy and safety of nanomedicines, providing a way to develop personalized nanomedicines by harnessing disease-related metabolites.

Can Traditional Food Product Communication Convey Safety to the Younger Generations? The Role of Sustainable Packaging.	Traditional food products (TFPs) represent a defining part of one's culture, identity, and heritage with crucial economic, cultural, and environmental benefits in society. Younger generations have a positive idea of TFPs, even if this does not lead to actual purchase, possibly due to the fact that they are often perceived to not meet safety criteria. This study focuses on product communication (CP) and packaging referring to the territory (PT) and to sustainability (SP) in order to verify if these have a direct or mediated impact on perceived product safety (PPS). A structural equation model was conducted on a sample of 1079 young Italian cheese consumers. The results allowed us to confirm the hypothesized impact of CP on PPS through the mediation of PT and, particularly, SP. SP has a crucial communicative role in the model, demonstrating the ability to enhance the perception of the safety of TFPs. This research adds to the knowledge in the field of TFPs, focusing on communication and sustainable packaging as crucial factors conveying healthiness, nutritiousness, and perceived safety, consequently leading to a greater diffusion of the products themselves in the market.	dairy; food safety; healthiness; packaging; sustainability; territory; traditional food consumer; traditional food product; young consumers

Associations between Participant Characteristics and Participant Feedback about an Unsupervised Online Cognitive Assessment in a Research Registry.	BACKGROUND: This study aims to understand whether and how participant characteristics (age, gender, education, ethnocultural identity) are related to their feedback about taking a remote, unsupervised, online cognitive assessment. METHODS: The Brain Health Registry is a public online registry which includes cognitive assessments. Multivariable ordinal regressions assessed associations between participant characteristics and feedback responses of older (55+) participants (N=11,553) regarding their Cogstate Brief Battery assessment experience. RESULTS: Higher age, secondary education or less, Latino identity, and female gender were associated with a poorer assessment experience; higher age and a non-White identity were associated with experiencing the assessment instructions as less clear; and higher age, non-White identity, and secondary education or less were associated with rating additional human support with the assessment as more useful. DISCUSSION: Our findings highlight the importance of improving the design and instructions of unsupervised, remote, online cognitive assessments to better suit the needs of diverse communities.

Brain function connectivity, derived from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), has enjoyed high popularity in the studies of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) diagnosis. Albeit rapid progress has been made, most studies still suffer from several knotty issues: (1) the hardship of modeling the sophisticated brain neuronal connectivity; (2) the mismatch of identically graph node setup to the variations of different brain regions; (3) the dimensionality explosion resulted from excessive voxels in each fMRI sample; (4) the poor interpretability giving rise to unpersuasive diagnosis. To ameliorate these issues, we propose a position-aware graph-convolution-network-based model, namely PLSNet, with superior accuracy and compelling built-in interpretability for ASD diagnosis. Specifically, a time-series encoder is designed for context-rich feature extraction, followed by a function connectivity generator to model the correlation with long range dependencies. In addition, to discriminate the brain nodes with different locations, the position embedding technique is adopted, giving a unique identity to each graph region. We then embed a rarefying method to sift the salient nodes during message diffusion, which would also benefit the reduction of the dimensionality complexity. Extensive experiments conducted on Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange demonstrate that our PLSNet achieves state-of-the-art performance. Notably, on CC200 atlas, PLSNet reaches an accuracy of 76.4% and a specificity of 78.6%, overwhelming the previous state-of-the-art with 2.5% and 6.5% under five-fold cross-validation policy. Moreover, the most salient brain regions predicted by PLSNet are closely consistent with the theoretical knowledge in the medical domain, providing potential biomarkers for ASD clinical diagnosis.

Classification of Parkinson's Disease from Voice - Analysis of Data Selection Bias.	A growing number of studies have been researching biomarkers of Parkinson's disease (PD) using mobile technology. Many have shown high accuracy in PD classification using machine learning (ML) and voice records from the mPower study, a large database of PD patients and healthy controls. Since the dataset has unbalanced class, gender and age distribution, it is important to consider appropriate sampling when assessing classification scores. We analyse biases, such as identity confounding and implicit learning of non-disease-specific characteristics and present a sampling strategy to highlight and prevent these problems.

Alteration of surface morphology and core features in adolescents with borderline personality disorder.	BACKGROUND: Accurate early diagnosis of adolescent borderline personality disorder (BPD) is critical for prompt treatment. The aim of this study was to assess the alteration of brain surface morphology and to evaluate its relationship with core features in adolescent BPD. METHODS: A total of 52 adolescents with BPD aged 12-17 years and 39 age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HCs) were prospectively enrolled into the study. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was obtained with both 3D-T1 weighted structural sequence and resting-state functional data. The structural data was analyzed for surface morphology parameters including the local gyrification index (LGI), mean curvature and surface area. The functional MRI data was analyzed for seed-based functional connectivity (FC). Correlative analysis of surface morphology and core features of adolescent BPD was performed. RESULTS: Adolescents with BPD showed the following altered surface morphology in the limbic-cortical circuit when compared to the HCs: (1) reduced LGI in the left fusiform and right superior temporal gyrus; (2) reduced mean curvature in the left precentral gyrus and right rostral anterior cingulate cortex, and increased mean curvature in the bilateral pericalcarine; and (3) reduced surface area in the left paracentral gyrus, left pars triangularis, right insula and right lateral orbitofrontal gyrus (P < 0.05, FWE correction). In addition, these brain regions with altered surface morphology were significantly correlated with several core features including the mood instability, self-identity problems, and non-suicidal self-injury behavior in adolescents with BPD (P < 0.05). Furthermore, there was enhanced functional connectivity among these altered brain regions within the limbic-cortical circuit (voxel P < 0.001, cluster P < 0.05, FWE corrected). CONCLUSIONS: Adolescents with BPD had significant alterations of brain surface morphology in the limbic-cortical circuit, which was correlated with core BPD features. These results implicated the surface morphology parameters and FC alterations may potentially serve as neuroimaging biomarkers for adolescents with BPD.

Facilitators and Barriers Influencing Antipsychotic Medication Prescribing and Deprescribing Practices in Critically Ill Adult Patients: a Qualitative Study.	BACKGROUND: Antipsychotic medications do not alter the incidence or duration of delirium, but these medications are frequently prescribed and continued at transitions of care in critically ill patients when they may no longer be necessary or appropriate. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to identify and describe relevant domains and constructs that influence antipsychotic medication prescribing and deprescribing practices among physicians, nurses, and pharmacists that care for critically ill adult patients during and following critical illness. DESIGN: We conducted qualitative semi-structured interviews with critical care and ward healthcare professionals including physicians, nurses, and pharmacists to understand antipsychotic prescribing and deprescribing practices for critically ill adult patients during and following critical illness. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-one interviews were conducted with 11 physicians, five nurses, and five pharmacists from predominantly academic centres in Alberta, Canada, between July 6 and October 29, 2021. MAIN MEASURES: We used deductive thematic analysis using the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) to identify and describe constructs within relevant domains. KEY RESULTS: Seven TDF domains were identified as relevant from the analysis: Social/Professional role and identity; Beliefs about capabilities; Reinforcement; Motivations and goals; Memory, attention, and decision processes; Environmental context and resources; and Beliefs about consequences. Participants reported antipsychotic prescribing for multiple indications beyond delirium and agitation including patient and staff safety, sleep management, and environmental factors such as staff availability and workload. Participants identified potential antipsychotic deprescribing strategies to reduce ongoing antipsychotic medication prescriptions for critically ill patients including direct communication tools between prescribers at transitions of care. CONCLUSIONS: Critical care and ward healthcare professionals report several factors influencing established antipsychotic medication prescribing practices. These factors aim to maintain patient and staff safety to facilitate the provision of care to patients with delirium and agitation limiting adherence to current guideline recommendations.	antipsychotic medications; critical care; deprescribing; prescribing practices; theoretical domains framework; transitions of care

The Role of Rab GTPases in the development of genetic and malignant diseases.	Small GTPases have been shown to play an important role in several cellular functions, including cytoskeletal remodeling, cell polarity, intracellular trafficking, cell-cycle, progression and lipid transformation. The Ras-associated binding (Rab) family of GTPases constitutes the largest family of GTPases and consists of almost 70 known members of small GTPases in humans, which are known to play an important role in the regulation of intracellular membrane trafficking, membrane identity, vesicle budding, uncoating, motility and fusion of membranes. Mutations in Rab genes can cause a wide range of inherited genetic diseases, ranging from neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) to immune dysregulation/deficiency syndromes, like Griscelli Syndrome Type II (GS-II) and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), as well as a variety of cancers. Here, we provide an extended overview of human Rabs, discussing their function and diseases related to Rabs and Rab effectors, as well as focusing on effects of (aberrant) Rab expression. We aim to underline their importance in health and the development of genetic and malignant diseases by assessing their role in cellular structure, regulation, function and biology and discuss the possible use of stem cell gene therapy, as well as targeting of Rabs in order to treat malignancies, but also to monitor recurrence of cancer and metastasis through the use of Rabs as biomarkers. Future research should shed further light on the roles of Rabs in the development of multifactorial diseases, such as diabetes and assess Rabs as a possible treatment target.

[Cerebrolysin in the treatment of cognitive impairment].	Cognitive impairment is one of the most important problems of modern health care. Currently, according to WHO, more than 55 million people worldwide are living with dementia. Dementia is one of the leading causes of disability and addiction among older people worldwide. Even more significant is the number of patients with mild cognitive impairment who have an increased risk of progression to dementia compared to people of the same age without cognitive impairment. The number of patients with cognitive impairment has also increased due to the consequences of COVID-19. It is necessary to use drugs that not only improve cognitive functions, but also slow down their progression. One of these drugs is cerebrolysin, the effectiveness of which has been confirmed in various types of cognitive impairment. Cerebrolysin, being a preparation from the brain of a pig, belongs to the group of biological drugs. In the production of Cerebrolysin very strict measures are taken to comply with the technology, which ensures the quality and identity of the product from batch to batch. The experience of many years of clinical use of Cerebrolysin testifies not only to its high efficiency, but also to its safety. It should be taken into account that similar substances can be developed in relation to biological products - biosimilars or biosimilars, which can be considered comparable only in case of equivalent pharmacokinetic parameters, efficacy and safety. Когнитивные нарушения (КН) представляют одну из важнейших проблем современного здравоохранения. По данным ВОЗ, в настоящее время более 55 млн человек во всем мире живут с деменцией. Деменция — одна из основных причин инвалидности и зависимости у пожилых людей. Еще более значительным является число пациентов с умеренными КН, которые имеют повышенный риск прогрессирования до степени деменции по сравнению с лицами того же возраста без когнитивных расстройств. Число больных с КН также увеличилось в связи с последствиями перенесенного COVID-19. Необходимо применение препаратов, способных не только улучшать когнитивные функции, но и замедлять прогрессирование КН. Одним из таких препаратов является Церебролизин, эффективность которого была подтверждена при различных видах КН. Церебролизин, изготовленный из головного мозга свиньи, относится к группе биологических лекарственных препаратов. При производстве Церебролизина соблюдаются очень строгие требования к технологии изготовления, что обеспечивает качество и идентичность продукта от серии к серии. Опыт многолетнего клинического применения Церебролизина свидетельствует не только о его высокой эффективности, но и о безопасности. Необходимо учитывать, что разрабатываемые сходные с биопрепаратами вещества (биоподобные препараты или биоаналоги) могут считаться сопоставимыми только в случае эквивалентности фармакокинетических параметров, показателей эффективности и безопасности.

Neurodegenerative disease among male elite football (soccer) players in Sweden: a cohort study.	BACKGROUND: Football (soccer) players might be at increased risk of neurodegenerative disease, which has led to questions regarding the safety of the sport and recent measures introduced by football associations to reduce heading of the ball. We aimed to assess the risk of neurodegenerative disease among male football players in the Swedish top division Allsvenskan, compared with matched controls. METHODS: In this cohort study, we identified all male football players (amateurs and professionals) who had played at least one game in Allsvenskan from Aug 1, 1924 to Dec 31, 2019 and excluded players whose personal identity number could not be retrieved or be identified in the Total Population Register, and those who were not born in Sweden and who had immigrated to the country after age 15 years. Football players were matched with up to ten controls from the general population according to sex, age, and region of residence. We used nationwide registers to compare the risk of neurodegenerative disease (diagnoses recorded in death certificates, during hospital admissions and outpatient visits, or use of prescription drugs for dementia) among football players versus controls. We also assessed each type of neurodegenerative disease (Alzheimer's disease and other dementias, motor neuron disease, and Parkinson's disease) separately, and compared the risk of neurodegenerative disease among outfield players versus goalkeepers. FINDINGS: Of 7386 football players who had played at least one game in the top Swedish division between Aug 1, 1924, and Dec 31, 2019, 182 players were excluded for an unretrievable personal identity number, and 417 were excluded due to their number not being identified in the Total Population Register. After a further exclusion of 780 players and 11 627 controls who were born outside of Sweden and who had immigrated to the country after age 15 years, 6007 football players (510 goalkeepers) were included in the study population along with 56 168 matched controls. During follow-up to Dec 31, 2020, 537 (8·9%) of 6007 football players and 3485 (6·2%) of 56 168 controls were diagnosed with neurodegenerative disease. The risk of neurodegenerative disease was higher among football players than controls (hazard ratio [HR] 1·46 [95% CI 1·33-1·60]). Alzheimer's disease and other dementias were more common among football players than controls (HR 1·62 [95% CI 1·47-1·78]), significant group differences were not observed for motor neuron disease (HR 1·27 [0·73-2·22]), and Parkinson's disease was less common among football players (HR 0·68 [0·52-0·89]). The risk of neurodegenerative disease was higher for outfield players than controls (HR 1·50 [95% CI 1·36-1·65]) but not for goalkeepers versus controls (HR 1·07 [0·78-1·47]), and outfield players had a higher risk of neurodegenerative disease than did goalkeepers (HR 1·43 [1·03-1·99]). All-cause mortality was slightly lower among football players than controls (HR 0·95 [95% CI 0·91-0·99]). INTERPRETATION: In this cohort study, male football players who had played in the Swedish top division had a significantly increased risk of neurodegenerative disease compared with population controls. The risk increase was observed for Alzheimer's disease and other dementias but not for other types of neurodegenerative disease, and among outfield players, but not among goalkeepers. Our study expands on the data that can be used to assess and manage risks in the sport.

A single-nucleus transcriptomic atlas of primate testicular aging reveals exhaustion of the spermatogonial stem cell reservoir and loss of Sertoli cell homeostasis.	The testis is pivotal for male reproduction, and its progressive functional decline in aging is associated with infertility. However, the regulatory mechanism underlying primate testicular aging remains largely elusive. Here, we resolve the aging-related cellular and molecular alterations of primate testicular aging by establishing a single-nucleus transcriptomic atlas. Gene-expression patterns along the spermatogenesis trajectory revealed molecular programs associated with attrition of spermatogonial stem cell reservoir, disturbed meiosis and impaired spermiogenesis along the sequential continuum. Remarkably, Sertoli cell was identified as the cell type most susceptible to aging, given its deeply perturbed age-associated transcriptional profiles. Concomitantly, downregulation of the transcription factor Wilms' Tumor 1 (WT1), essential for Sertoli cell homeostasis, was associated with accelerated cellular senescence, disrupted tight junctions, and a compromised cell identity signature, which altogether may help create a hostile microenvironment for spermatogenesis. Collectively, our study depicts in-depth transcriptomic traits of non-human primate (NHP) testicular aging at single-cell resolution, providing potential diagnostic biomarkers and targets for therapeutic interventions against testicular aging and age-related male reproductive diseases.

Developing consensus-based recommendations for the delivery of dementia services for the LGBTQIA+ community in the Republic of Ireland.	BACKGROUND: The number of older LGBTQIA+ adults is set to rise significantly in the coming years. The rising numbers sit together with the rise in the number of people in Ireland diagnosed with dementia. In Ireland, no dementia-specific services exist for people from the LGBTQIA+ community. The aim of this research was to 1) identify the future needs that older LGBTQIA+ people and their care partners living in Ireland have in relation to dementia care service delivery; and 2) develop consensus-based recommendations for dementia service provision in Ireland. METHODS: A six-phase consensus process was used to develop the lists of needs and recommendations: 1) development; 2) national survey; 3) interviews with key stakeholders; 4) international review of best practice; 5) consensus meeting; 6) final member checking. Participants, aged over 50, were based in Ireland, identified as a member of the LGBTQIA+ community, or supported someone who is/was. RESULTS: Results are reported from the survey (n=49), individual interviews (n=8), and the consensus meeting (n=10). Participants have concerns related to identity management and suppression, creating an LGBTQIA+ affirmative ethos and workforce, and respect and safety. From the results and consensus process, a full list of ten prioritised needs and recommendations have been developed that focus specifically on dementia care in Ireland for the LGBTQIA+ community. CONCLUSION: The older LGBTQIA+ community has identified essential priorities for improving healthcare access and safety. These priorities need to be urgently implemented into clinical and dementia care services.

Circulating exosomal immuno-oncological checkpoints and cytokines are potential biomarkers to monitor tumor response to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy in non-small cell lung cancer patients.	Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) including anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 antibodies, have significantly changed the treatment outcomes of NSCLC patients with better overall survival. However, 15-40% of the patients still fail to respond to ICIs therapy. Identification of biomarkers associated with responses are mandated in order to increase the efficacy of such therapy. In this study we evaluated 27 serum-derived exosomal immuno-oncological proteins and 44 cytokines/chemokines before and after ICIs therapy in 17 NSCLC patients to identify surrogate biomarkers for treatment/monitoring patient stratification for maximum therapeutic benefit. We first confirmed the identity of the isolated exosomes to have their specific markers (CD63, CD81, HSP70 and CD91). We have demonstrated that baseline concentration of exosomal-PD-L1 (p<0.0001), exosomal-PD-L2 (p=0.0413) and exosomal-PD-1 (p=0.0131) from NSCLC patients were significantly higher than their soluble-free forms. Furthermore, the exosomal-PD-L1 was present in all the patients (100%), while only 71% of patients expressed tissue PD-L1. This indicates that exosomal-PD-L1 is a more reliable diagnostic biomarker. Interestingly, exosomal-PD-L2 expression was significantly higher (p=0.0193) in tissue PD-L1-negative patients compared to tissue PD-L1-positive patients. We have also shown that immuno-oncological proteins isolated from pre-ICIs treated patients were significantly higher in exosomes compared to their soluble-free counterparts (CD152, p=0.0008; CD80, p=0.0182; IDO, p=0.0443; Arginase, p<0.0001; Nectin-2, p<0.0001; NT5E, p<0.0001; Siglec-7, p<0.0001; Siglec-9, p=0.0335; CD28, p=0.0092; GITR, p<0.0001; MICA, p<0.0001). Finally, the changes in the expression levels of exosomal immuno-oncological proteins/cytokines and their correlation with tumor response to ICIs treatment were assessed. There was a significant downregulation of exosomal PD-L1 (p=0.0156), E-Cadherin (p=0.0312), ULBP1 (p=0.0156), ULBP3 (p=0.0391), MICA (p=0.0391), MICB (p=0.0469), Siglec7 (p=0.0078) and significant upregulation of exosomal PD-1 (p=0.0156) and IFN- γ (p=0.0156) in responding patients. Non-responding patients showed a significant increase in exosomal-PD-L1 (p=0.0078). Furthermore, responding-patients without liver-metastasis showed significant-upregulation of PD-1 (p=0.0070), and downregulation of ULBP1 (p=0.0137) and Siglec-7 (p=0.0037). Non-responding patients had significant-downregulation of ULBP3 (p=0.0317) in patient without brain-metastasis and significant-upregulation/downregulation of PD-L1 and ULBP3 (p=0.0262/0.0286) in patients with pulmonary-metastasis. We demonstrated for the first time that exosomal immuno-oncological proteins/cytokines are potential biomarkers to monitor response to ICIs therapy and can predict the clinical outcomes in NSCLC patients.

Genetically engineered mesenchymal stem cells with dopamine synthesis for Parkinson's disease in animal models.	Although striatal delivery of three critical genes for dopamine synthesis by viruses is a potential clinical approach for treating Parkinson's disease (PD), the approach makes it difficult to finely control dopamine secretion amounts and brings safety concerns. Here, we generate genetically engineered mesenchymal stem cells encoding three critical genes for dopamine synthesis (DOPA-MSCs). DOPA-MSCs retain their MSC identity and stable ability to secrete dopamine during passaging. Following transplantation, DOPA-MSCs reinstate striatal dopamine levels and correct motor function in PD rats. Importantly, after grafting into the caudate and putamen, DOPA-MSCs provide homotopic reconstruction of midbrain dopamine pathways by restoring striatal dopamine levels, and safely and long-term (up to 51 months) correct motor disorders and nonmotor deficits in acute and chronic PD rhesus monkey models of PD even with advanced PD symptoms. The long-term benefits and safety results support the idea that the development of dopamine-synthesized engineered cell transplantation is an important strategy for treating PD.

The utilization of artificial intelligence in studying the dysregulation of gene expression in Alzheimer's disease (AD) affected brain tissues remains underexplored, particularly in delineating common and specific transcriptomic signatures across different brain regions implicated in AD-related cellular and molecular processes, which could help illuminate novel disease biology for biomarker and target discovery. Herein we developed a deep learning framework, which consisted of multi-layer perceptron (MLP) models to classify neuropathologically confirmed AD versus controls, using bulk tissue RNA-seq data from the RNAseq Harmonization Study of the Accelerating Medicines Project for Alzheimer's Disease (AMP-AD) consortium. The models were trained based on data from three distinct brain regions, including dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), and head of the caudate nucleus (HCN), obtained from the Religious Orders Study/Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP). Subsequently, we inferred a disease progression trajectory for each brain region by applying unsupervised dimensionality transformation to the distribution of the subjects' expression profiles. To interpret the MLP models, we employed an interpretable method for deep neural network models, obtaining SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values and identified the most significantly AD-implicated genes for gene co-expression network analysis. Our models demonstrated robust performance in classification and prediction across two other external datasets from the Mayo RNA-seq (MAYO) cohort and the Mount Sinai Brain Bank (MSBB) cohort of AMP-AD. By interpreting the models both mechanistically and biologically, our study elucidated subtle molecular alterations in various brain regions, uncovering shared transcriptomic signatures activated in microglia and sex-specific modules in neurons relevant to AD. Notably, we identified, for the first time, a sex-linked transcription factor pair (ZFX/ZFY) associated with more pronounced neuronal loss in AD females, shedding light on a novel mechanism for sex dimorphism in AD. This study lays the groundwork for leveraging artificial intelligence methodologies to investigate AD at the molecular level, which is not readily achievable from conventional analysis approaches such as differential gene expression (DGE) analysis. The transcription factor implicated in sex difference also underpins a new molecular mechanistic basis of women's greater neurodegeneration in AD warranting further study.

Identify Alzheimer's disease subtypes and markers from multi-omic data of human brain and blood with a subspace merging algorithm.	Identifying Alzheimer's disease (AD) subtypes is essential for AD diagnosis and treatment. We integrated multiomics data from brain tissues of the ROSMAP and MSBB studies using a subspace merging algorithm and identified two AD patient clusters with notable cognitive and AD pathology differences. Analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in brain and blood samples pinpointed the LDLR gene as a potential blood biomarker linked to brain gene expression changes. Furthermore, we conducted PheWAS analysis on All of Us Project's EHR and WGS dataset for 105 eQTLs associated with the DEGs and revealed significant associations between these eQTLs and several phenotypes, shedding light on potential regulatory roles of these genes in diverse physiological processes. Our study successfully integrated multiomics data and proposes LDLR as a candidate blood biomarker for AD subtyping. The identified phenotypic signatures provide valuable insights on molecular mechanisms underlying AD heterogeneity, paving the way for personalized AD treatment.

Comprehensive characterization of the RNA editing landscape in the human aging brains with Alzheimer's disease.	INTRODUCTION: While RNA editing has been linked to Alzheimer's disease (AD), its specific impact on the transcriptomic landscape in human AD brains remains under explored. METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive analysis of RNA editing across nine human brain regions affected by AD, utilizing RNA-seq data and matched whole-genome sequencing data from three human brain biobanks, adjusting for age, post mortem interval, sex, and apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4) status. RESULTS: RNA-editing events were identified in both AD and healthy control aging brains, highlighting 127 genes with significant RNA editing loci. AD exhibited elevated RNA editing in the parahippocampal gyrus and cerebellar cortex. We also discovered 147 colocalized genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and cis-edQTL (± 1 MB) signals in 48 likely causal genes encompassing CLU, BIN1, and GRIN3B, primarily allied to amyloid and tau pathology, and neuroinflammation. DISCUSSION: Our findings delineate RNA editing regulatory signatures in human AD, providing novel insights into AD pathophysiology and potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets. HIGHLIGHTS: ·We discovered genome-wide landscape of RNA editing signals from 4208 (1364 Alzheimer's disease [AD] cases vs. 742 healthy controls) RNA-seq data across nine human brain regions from three large brain biobanks (Mount Sinai Brain Bank [MSBB], Mayo Clinic [MAYO] Religious Order Study and Memory and Aging Project [ROSMAP]) tied with AD, including in sex-specific and apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4) -specific manner adjusting for age, post mortem interval (PMI), sex, and APOE4 status. ·We emphasize 127 genes, including SYT11, KCNIP4, NRG3, ANKS1B, and RALYL, exhibiting significant RNA editing loci shared by multiple brain tissues, mainly implicated in synaptic plasticity, signaling and transmission, neuronal development, and morphogenesis. ·Brain-wide tissue-specific cis-regulatory variants (cis-edQTLs) were inspected using matched genotyping data from 3627 samples from all brain biobanks. We revealed 147 colocalized AD-GWAS and cis-edQTLs signals pertaining to 48 likely causal genes comprising CLU (rs7982, rs1532278), BIN1 (rs2276582, rs3768863), GRIN3B (rs10417824, rs1058603), NYAP1 (rs12539172), DGKQ (rs4690197, rs3733347), CLPTM1 (rs204468), etc. ·Colocalized signals show affiliations to tau protein binding, amyloid-β regulation, cellular morphogenesis, and immune response pathway suggesting possible roles of epitranscriptomic mechanisms in shaping the AD risk.

BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVE: Alzheimer's Disease (AD) patients at multiple stages of disease progression have a high prevalence of seizures. However, whether AD and epilepsy share pathophysiological changes remains poorly defined. In this study, we leveraged high-throughput transcriptomic data from sporadic AD cases at different stages of cognitive impairment across multiple independent cohorts and brain regions to examine the role of epilepsy-causing genes. METHODS: Epilepsy-causing genes were manually curated, and their expression levels were analyzed across bulk transcriptomic data from three AD cohorts and three brain regions. RNA-seq data from sporadic AD and control cases from the Knight ADRC, MSBB, and ROSMAP cohorts were processed and analyzed under the same analytical pipeline. An integrative clustering approach employing machine learning and multi-omics data was employed to identify molecularly defined profiles with different cognitive scores. RESULTS: We found several epilepsy-associated genes/pathways significantly dysregulated in a group of AD patients with more severe cognitive impairment. We observed 15 genes consistently downregulated across the three cohorts, including sodium and potassium channels genes, suggesting that these genes play fundamental roles in cognitive function or AD progression. Notably, we found 25 of these genes dysregulated in earlier stages of AD and become worse with AD progression. CONCLUSION: Our findings revealed that epilepsy-causing genes showed changes in the early and late stages of AD progression, suggesting that they might be playing a role in AD progression. We can not establish directionality or cause-effect with our findings. However, changes in the epilepsy-causing genes might underlie the presence of seizures in AD patients, which might be present before or concurrently with the initial stages of AD.

Analysis of human brain RNA-seq data reveals combined effects of 4 types of RNA modifications and 18 types of programmed cell death on Alzheimer's disease.	BACKGROUND: RNA modification plays a critical role in Alzheimer's disease (AD) by modulating the expression and function of AD-related genes, thereby affecting AD occurrence and progression. Programmed cell death is closely related to neuronal death and associated with neuronal loss and cognitive function changes in AD. However, the mechanism of their joint action on AD remains unknown and requires further exploration. METHODS: We used the MSBB RNA-seq dataset to analyze the correlation between RNA modification, programmed cell death, and AD. We used combined studies of RNA modification and programmed cell death to distinguish subgroups of patients, and the results highlight the strong correlation between RNA modification-related programmed cell death and AD. A weighted gene co-expression network was constructed, and the pivotal roles of programmed cell death genes in key modules were identified. Finally, by combining unsupervised consensus clustering, gene co-expression networks, and machine learning algorithms, an RNA modification-related programmed cell death network was constructed, and the pivotal roles of programmed cell death genes in key modules were identified. An RNA modification-related programmed cell death risk score was calculated to predict the occurrence of AD. RESULTS: RPCD-related genes classified patients into subgroups with distinct clinical characteristics. Nineteen key genes were identified and an RPCD risk score was constructed based on the key genes. This score can be used for the diagnosis of AD and the assessment of disease progression in patients. The diagnostic efficacy of the RPCD risk score and the key genes was validated in the ROSMAP, GEO, and ADNI datasets. CONCLUSION: This study uncovered that RNA modification-related PCD is of significance for AD progression and early prediction, providing insights from a new perspective for the study of disease mechanisms in AD.

Human herpesvirus-associated transposable element activation in human aging brains with Alzheimer's disease.	INTRODUCTION: Human herpesvirus (HHV) has been linked to Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. METHODS: We leveraged functional genomics data from Religious Orders Study or the Rush Memory and Aging Project (ROS/MAP) and Mount Sinai Brain Bank (MSBB) brain biobanks and single-cell RNA-sequencing data from HHV-infected forebrain organoids to investigate HHV-infection-associated transposable element (TE) dysregulation underlying AD etiologies. RESULTS: We identified widespread TE dysregulation in HHV-positive human AD brains, including an astrocyte-specific upregulation of LINE1 subfamily TEs in HHV-positive human AD brains. We further pinpointed astrocyte-specific LINE1 upregulation that could potentially regulate target gene NEAT1 expression via long-range enhancer-promoter chromatin interactions. This LINE1 dysregulation can be partially reversed by the usage of anti-HHV drugs (valacyclovir and acyclovir) in a virus-infected human brain organoid model. Finally, we demonstrated that valacyclovir rescued tau-associated neuropathology and alleviated LINE1 activation in an experimental tau aggregation model. DISCUSSION: Our analysis provides associations linking molecular, clinical, and neuropathological AD features with HHV infection, which warrants future clinical validation. HIGHLIGHTS: Via analysis of bulk RNA-seq data in two large-scale human brain biobanks, ROS/MAP (n = 109 pathologically confirmed AD and n = 44 cognitively healthy controls) and MSBB (n = 284 AD and n = 150 cognitively healthy controls), we identified widespread TE activation in HHV-positive human AD brains and significantly positive associations of HHV RNA abundance with APOE4 genotype, Braak staging score, and CERAD score. We identified cell type-specific LINE1 upregulation in both microglia and astrocytes of human AD brains via long-range enhancer-promoter chromatin interactions on lncRNA nuclear enriched abundant transcript 1 (NEAT1). We determined that usage of valacyclovir and acyclovir was significantly associated with reduced incidence of AD in a large real-world patient database. Using the HEK293 tau P301S model and U2OS mt-Keima cell model, we determined that valacyclovir treatment rescued tau-associated neuropathology and alleviated activation of LINE1 with increased cellular autophagy-level mechanistically supported clinical benefits of valacyclovir in real-world patient data.

Transcriptomic analyses of human brains with Alzheimer's disease identified dysregulated epilepsy-causing genes.	BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVE: Alzheimer's Disease (AD) patients at multiple stages of disease progression have a high prevalence of seizures. However, whether AD and epilepsy share pathophysiological changes remains poorly defined. In this study, we leveraged high-throughput transcriptomic data from sporadic AD cases at different stages of cognitive impairment across multiple independent cohorts and brain regions to examine the role of epilepsy-causing genes. METHODS: Epilepsy-causing genes were manually curated, and their expression levels were analyzed across bulk transcriptomic data from three AD cohorts and three brain regions. RNA-seq data from sporadic AD and control cases from the Knight ADRC, MSBB, and ROSMAP cohorts were processed and analyzed under the same analytical pipeline. An integrative clustering approach employing machine learning and multi-omics data was employed to identify molecularly defined profiles with different cognitive scores. RESULTS: We found several epilepsy-associated genes/pathways significantly dysregulated in a group of AD patients with more severe cognitive impairment. We observed 15 genes consistently downregulated across the three cohorts, including sodium and potassium channels, suggesting that these genes play fundamental roles in cognitive function or AD progression. Notably, we found 25 of these genes dysregulated in earlier stages of AD and become worse with AD progression. CONCLUSION: Our findings showed that epilepsy-causing genes showed changes in the early and late stages of AD progression, suggesting that they might be playing a role in AD progression. We can not establish directionality or cause-effect with our findings. However, changes in the epilepsy-causing genes might underlie the presence of seizures in AD patients, which might be present before or concurrently with the initial stages of AD.

Predicting Alzheimer's Cognitive Resilience Score: A Comparative Study of Machine Learning Models Using RNA-seq Data.	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an important research topic. While amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles are hallmark pathological features of AD, cognitive resilience (CR) is a phenomenon where cognitive function remains preserved despite the presence of these pathological features. This study aimed to construct and compare predictive machine learning models for CR scores using RNA-seq data from the Religious Orders Study and Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP) and Mount Sinai Brain Bank (MSBB) cohorts. We evaluated support vector regression (SVR), random forest, XGBoost, linear, and transformer-based models. The SVR model exhibited the best performance, with contributing genes identified using Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) scores, providing insights into biological pathways associated with CR. Finally, we developed a tool called the resilience gene analyzer (REGA), which visualizes SHAP scores to interpret the contributions of individual genes to CR. REGA is available at https://igcore.cloud/GerOmics/REsilienceGeneAnalyzer/.	Alzheimer’s disease; Shapley additive explanations; machine learning; resilience gene analyzer; transcriptomics

Cell-type specific inference from bulk RNA-sequencing data by integrating single cell reference profiles via EPIC-unmix.	Cell type specific (CTS) analysis is essential to reveal biological insights obscured in bulk tissue data. However, single-cell (sc) or single-nuclei (sn) resolution data are still cost-prohibitive for large-scale samples. Thus, computational methods to perform deconvolution from bulk tissue data are highly valuable. We here present EPIC-unmix, a novel two-step empirical Bayesian method integrating reference sc/sn RNA-seq data and bulk RNA-seq data from target samples to enhance the accuracy of CTS inference. We demonstrate through comprehensive simulations across three tissues that EPIC-unmix achieved 4.6% - 109.8% higher accuracy compared to alternative methods. By applying EPIC-unmix to human bulk brain RNA-seq data from the ROSMAP and MSBB cohorts, we identified multiple genes differentially expressed between Alzheimer's disease (AD) cases versus controls in a CTS manner, including 57.4% novel genes not identified using similar sample size sc/snRNA-seq data, indicating the power of our

Alzheimer's disease rewires gene coexpression networks coupling different brain regions.	Connectome studies have shown how Alzheimer's disease (AD) disrupts functional and structural connectivity among brain regions. But the molecular basis of such disruptions is less studied, with most genomic/transcriptomic studies performing within-brain-region analyses. To inspect how AD rewires the correlation structure among genes in different brain regions, we performed an Inter-brain-region Differential Correlation (Inter-DC) analysis of RNA-seq data from Mount Sinai Brain Bank on four brain regions (frontal pole, superior temporal gyrus, parahippocampal gyrus and inferior frontal gyrus, comprising 264 AD and 372 control human post-mortem samples). An Inter-DC network was assembled from all pairs of genes across two brain regions that gained (or lost) correlation strength in the AD group relative to controls at FDR 1%. The differentially correlated (DC) genes in this network complemented known differentially expressed genes in AD, and likely reflects cell-intrinsic changes since we adjusted for cell compositional effects. Each brain region used a distinctive set of DC genes when coupling with other regions, with parahippocampal gyrus showing the most rewiring, consistent with its known vulnerability to AD. The Inter-DC network revealed master dysregulation hubs in AD (at genes ZKSCAN1, SLC5A3, RCC1, IL17RB, PLK4, etc.), inter-region gene modules enriched for known AD pathways (synaptic signaling, endocytosis, etc.), and candidate signaling molecules that could mediate region-region communication. The Inter-DC network generated in this study is a valuable resource of gene pairs, pathways and signaling molecules whose inter-brain-region functional coupling is disrupted in AD, thereby offering a new perspective of AD etiology.

Age, Sex and Alzheimer's disease: A longitudinal study of 3xTg-AD mice reveals sex-specific disease trajectories and inflammatory responses mirrored in postmortem brains from Alzheimer's patients.	BACKGROUND: Aging and sex are major risk factors for developing late-onset Alzheimer's disease. Compared to men, women are not only nearly twice as likely to develop Alzheimer's, but they also experience worse neuropathological burden and cognitive decline despite living longer with the disease. It remains unclear how and when sex differences in biological aging emerge and contribute to Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis. We hypothesized that these differences lead to distinct pathological and molecular Alzheimer's disease signatures in males and females, which could be harnessed for therapeutic and biomarker development. METHODS: We aged male and female, 3xTg-AD and B6129 (WT) control mice across their respective lifespans while longitudinally collecting brain, liver, spleen, and plasma samples (n=3-8 mice per sex, strain, and age group). We performed histological analyses on all tissues and assessed neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease, markers of hepatic inflammation, as well as splenic mass and morphology. Additionally, we measured concentrations of cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors in the plasma. We conducted RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) analysis on bulk brain tissue and examined differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between 3xTg-AD and WT samples and across ages in each sex. We also examined DEGs between clinical Alzheimer's and control parahippocampal gyrus brain tissue samples from the Mount Sinai Brain Bank (MSBB) study in each sex. RESULTS: 3xTg-AD females significantly outlived 3xTg-AD males and exhibited progressive Alzheimer's neuropathology, while 3xTg-AD males demonstrated progressive hepatic inflammation, splenomegaly, circulating inflammatory proteins, and next to no Alzheimer's neuropathological hallmarks. Instead, 3xTg-AD males experienced an accelerated upregulation of immune-related gene expression in the brain relative to females, further suggesting distinct inflammatory disease trajectories between the sexes. Clinical investigations revealed that 3xTg-AD brain aging phenotypes are not an artifact of the animal model, and individuals with Alzheimer's disease develop similar sex-specific alterations in canonical pathways related to neuronal signaling and immune function. Interestingly, we observed greater upregulation of complement-related gene expression, and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was predicted as the top upstream regulator of DEGs in diseased males of both species. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate that chronic inflammation and complement activation are associated with increased mortality, revealing that age-related changes in immune response act as a primary driver of sex differences in Alzheimer's disease trajectories. We propose a model of disease pathogenesis in 3xTg-AD males in which aging and transgene-driven disease progression trigger an inflammatory response, mimicking the effects of LPS stimulation despite the absence of infection.

Multi-omic atlas of the parahippocampal gyrus in Alzheimer's disease.	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia worldwide, with a projection of 151 million cases by 2050. Previous genetic studies have identified three main genes associated with early-onset familial Alzheimer's disease, however this subtype accounts for less than 5% of total cases. Next-generation sequencing has been well established and holds great promise to assist in the development of novel therapeutics as well as biomarkers to prevent or slow the progression of this devastating disease. Here we present a public resource of functional genomic data from the parahippocampal gyrus of 201 postmortem control, mild cognitively impaired (MCI) and AD individuals from the Mount Sinai brain bank, of which whole-genome sequencing (WGS), and bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) were previously published. The genomic data include bulk proteomics and DNA methylation, as well as cell-type-specific RNA-seq and assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with high-throughput sequencing (ATAC-seq) data. We have performed extensive preprocessing and quality control, allowing the research community to access and utilize this public resource available on the Synapse platform at https://doi.org/10.7303/syn51180043.2 .

Pooled analysis of frontal lobe transcriptomic data identifies key mitophagy gene changes in Alzheimer's disease brain.	BACKGROUND: The growing prevalence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is becoming a global health challenge without effective treatments. Defective mitochondrial function and mitophagy have recently been suggested as etiological factors in AD, in association with abnormalities in components of the autophagic machinery like lysosomes and phagosomes. Several large transcriptomic studies have been performed on different brain regions from AD and healthy patients, and their data represent a vast source of important information that can be utilized to understand this condition. However, large integration analyses of these publicly available data, such as AD RNA-Seq data, are still missing. In addition, large-scale focused analysis on mitophagy, which seems to be relevant for the aetiology of the disease, has not yet been performed. METHODS: In this study, publicly available raw RNA-Seq data generated from healthy control and sporadic AD post-mortem human samples of the brain frontal lobe were collected and integrated. Sex-specific differential expression analysis was performed on the combined data set after batch effect correction. From the resulting set of differentially expressed genes, candidate mitophagy-related genes were identified based on their known functional roles in mitophagy, the lysosome, or the phagosome, followed by Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) and microRNA-mRNA network analysis. The expression changes of candidate genes were further validated in human skin fibroblast and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs)-derived cortical neurons from AD patients and matching healthy controls. RESULTS: From a large dataset (AD: 589; control: 246) based on three different datasets (i.e., ROSMAP, MSBB, & GSE110731), we identified 299 candidate mitophagy-related differentially expressed genes (DEG) in sporadic AD patients (male: 195, female: 188). Among these, the AAA ATPase VCP, the GTPase ARF1, the autophagic vesicle forming protein GABARAPL1 and the cytoskeleton protein actin beta ACTB were selected based on network degrees and existing literature. Changes in their expression were further validated in AD-relevant human CONCLUSION: Through the joint analysis of multiple publicly available data sets, we identify four differentially expressed key mitophagy-related genes potentially relevant for the pathogenesis of sporadic AD. Changes in expression of these four genes were validated using two AD-relevant human	ARF1; Alzheimer's disease; GABARAPL1; VCP; lysosome; mitochondria; mitophagy; transcriptomics

The fusiform gyrus exhibits differential gene-gene co-expression in Alzheimer's disease.	Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is an irreversible neurodegenerative disease clinically characterized by the presence of β-amyloid plaques and tau deposits in various regions of the brain. However, the underlying factors that contribute to the development of AD remain unclear. Recently, the fusiform gyrus has been identified as a critical brain region associated with mild cognitive impairment, which may increase the risk of AD development. In our study, we performed gene co-expression and differential co-expression network analyses, as well as gene-expression-based prediction, using RNA-seq transcriptome data from post-mortem fusiform gyrus tissue samples collected from both cognitively healthy individuals and those with AD. We accessed differential co-expression networks in large cohorts such as ROSMAP, MSBB, and Mayo, and conducted over-representation analyses of gene pathways and gene ontology. Our results comprise four exclusive gene hubs in co-expression modules of Alzheimer's Disease, including	Alzheimer's disease; brain tissue; co-expression networks; differential co-expression networks; fusiform gyrus; hub genes; regulatory networks

Glial changes and gene expression in Alzheimer's disease from snRNA-Seq and spatial transcriptomics.	BackgroundAlzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by cortical atrophy, glutamatergic neuron loss, and cognitive decline. However, large-scale quantitative assessments of cellular changes during AD pathology remain scarce.ObjectiveThis study aims to integrate single-nuclei sequencing data from the Seattle Alzheimer's Disease Cortical Atlas (SEA-AD) with spatial transcriptomics to quantify cellular changes in the prefrontal cortex and temporal gyrus, regions vulnerable to AD neuropathological changes (ADNC).MethodsWe mapped differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and analyzed their interactions with pathological factors such as APOE expression and Lewy bodies. Cellular proportions were assessed, focusing on neurons, glial cells, and immune cells.ResultsRORB-expressing L4-like neurons, though vulnerable to ADNC, exhibited stable cell numbers throughout disease progression. In contrast, astrocytes displayed increased reactivity, with upregulated cytokine signaling and oxidative stress responses, suggesting a role in neuroinflammation. A reduction in synaptic maintenance pathways indicated a decline in astrocytic support functions. Microglia showed heightened immune surveillance and phagocytic activity, indicating their role in maintaining cortical homeostasis.ConclusionsThe study underscores the critical roles of glial cells, particularly astrocytes and microglia, in AD progression. These findings contribute to a better understanding of cellular dynamics and may inform therapeutic strategies targeting glial cell function in AD.

Integrated multimodal cell atlas of Alzheimer's disease.	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia in older adults. Neuropathological and imaging studies have demonstrated a progressive and stereotyped accumulation of protein aggregates, but the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms driving AD progression and vulnerable cell populations affected by disease remain coarsely understood. The current study harnesses single cell and spatial genomics tools and knowledge from the BRAIN Initiative Cell Census Network to understand the impact of disease progression on middle temporal gyrus cell types. We used image-based quantitative neuropathology to place 84 donors spanning the spectrum of AD pathology along a continuous disease pseudoprogression score and multiomic technologies to profile single nuclei from each donor, mapping their transcriptomes, epigenomes, and spatial coordinates to a common cell type reference with unprecedented resolution. Temporal analysis of cell-type proportions indicated an early reduction of Somatostatin-expressing neuronal subtypes and a late decrease of supragranular intratelencephalic-projecting excitatory and Parvalbumin-expressing neurons, with increases in disease-associated microglial and astrocytic states. We found complex gene expression differences, ranging from global to cell type-specific effects. These effects showed different temporal patterns indicating diverse cellular perturbations as a function of disease progression. A subset of donors showed a particularly severe cellular and molecular phenotype, which correlated with steeper cognitive decline. We have created a freely available public resource to explore these data and to accelerate progress in AD research at SEA-AD.org.

Midlife Physical Activity, Disease Symptoms, and Quality of Life in Parkinson's Disease: A Structural Equation Modeling Approach.	BACKGROUND: While higher levels of physical activity (PA) during midlife are associated with lower risk and later onset of Parkinson's disease (PD), it is not understood how PA is related to PD symptoms and quality of life (QOL). The purpose of this study was to determine the direct and indirect effects of midlife PA on PD-related QOL. METHODS: Data were obtained from the Fox Insight Study (n = 38,321) and included demographics, weekly hours of midlife PA (ages 36-55), neurobehavioral symptoms, nonmotor somatic symptoms, motor activities of daily living, and PD-related QOL. Structural equation modeling was conducted on those with complete data (n = 1765) to determine direct and indirect relationships of midlife PA to PD-related QOL. RESULTS: Older age, greater proportion of males, and fewer comorbidities were found in the higher PA groups. The final model included paths from midlife PA to PD-related QOL directly and through 3 moderating variables (neurobehavioral symptoms, motor activities of daily living, and nonmotor somatic symptoms), resulting in a total standardized effect of PA on QOL of β = -0.036. Effects varied in directionality and strength. The standardized effect of neurobehavioral symptoms on QOL (β = 0.904) was more than double that of motor activities of daily living (β = 0.41). The final model explained 80% of variance in PD-related QOL. CONCLUSIONS: Higher levels of midlife PA were associated with reduced neurobehavioral burden, suggesting premorbid PA may be critical to lessening the burden of mood and cognitive symptoms, which are known contributors to deterioration in QOL.	neuropsychiatric; nonmotor symptoms; premorbid factors; structural equation modeling

Dysphagia Is Associated with Incident Non-Motor Symptoms in Parkinson's Disease.	BACKGROUND: Up to 80% of persons with Parkinson's disease (PwPD) have dysphagia. However, existing studies are based on small cohorts and the relationship between dysphagia and other motor and nonmotor symptoms (NMS) remains incompletely understood. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the relationship between motor and NMS in PwPD with vs without dysphagia. METHODS: Among 20,365 PwPD in the Michael J. Fox Foundation database who completed ≥2 NMS surveys, 12,678 (62%) reported dysphagia on ≥1 survey. We examined associations between dysphagia and: (1) self-reported motor symptoms (UPDRS Part II), other NMS, quality of life (QoL), comorbidity score, depression, and daily activities at baseline; and (2) development of new NMS. RESULTS: Compared to PwPD without dysphagia, those with dysphagia were more likely to have had PD for >5 years, more severe motor and NMS, higher comorbidity scores, and a greater impairment in daily activities (P < 0.001). The prevalence of dysphagia increased with the severity of motor symptoms at the index survey (P < 0.001). At baseline, all NMS were significantly associated with dysphagia. Compared to PwPD who did not have dysphagia, PwPD with dysphagia were at increased risk of developing every NMS, even after adjusting for ages at PD diagnosis and index survey, sex, cognitive impairment, UPDRS, NMS and comorbidity scores. For most NMS, the risk of progression was greater in those with cognitive impairment or elevated NMS scores. CONCLUSIONS: Dysphagia in PwPD is associated with more severe motor and non-motor symptoms, reduced QoL, and an increased risk of future NMS.

The role of physical activity (PA) in the management of PD symptoms is increasingly recognized. PURPOSE: To examine the effects of PA levels on PD motor and nonmotor symptoms, and health-related quality of life, using the Fox Insight study's data set. It also examines PA's moderating effects on the age-PD motor function relationship. METHODS: In this cross-sectional observational study, 1,288 participants with PD (55.8% men, age: 64.54 ± 9.99) from the Fox Insight study were divided into four groups (N = 322 each) based on their PA level as measured by the Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly (PASE). PD motor and nonmotor symptoms were assessed using the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale-2 (UPDRS-2), Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire-8 (PDQ-8), Geriatric Depression Scale-Short Form, Penn Parkinson's Daily Activities Questionnaire-15, and EuroQol-Visual Analog Scale. Statistical analyses included Kruskal-Wallis, Pearson's correlation, and multiple linear regression, with alpha set at .05. RESULTS: Higher PASE correlated with better UPDRS-2, Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire-8, Geriatric Depression Scale-Short Form, Penn Parkinson's Daily Activities Questionnaire-15, and EuroQol-Visual Analog Scale. The study found significant influences of PASE on UPDRS-2, age, Geriatric Depression Scale-Short Form, body mass index, and EQ-VAS (R2adj = .174, F = 53.998, p < .001). Notably, PASE moderated the relationship between age and UPDRS-2, suggesting a pivoting role in slowing PD-related symptom progression with age (R2adj = .145, F = 73.47, p < .001). CONCLUSION: Increased PA levels are associated with better outcomes in PD motor and nonmotor symptoms, improved PD-related quality of life, and a slowed progression of PD symptoms. IMPLICATIONS: Promoting higher levels of PA in older adults with PD effectively manages motor and nonmotor symptoms of PD. In addition, early and consistent PA is the key to moderating the progression of PD symptoms.

Prevalence and associations of self-reported sleep problems in a large sample of patients with Parkinson's disease.	Sleep problems are important comorbid features of, and risk factors for, neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease (PD). To assess the prevalence and associations of sleep problems in patients with PD we analysed data from almost 54,000 participants in the Fox Insight study, including data from 38,588 patients with PD. Sleep problems are common in PD, with ~84% of respondents with PD reporting difficulty falling or staying asleep. Experiences of insomnia, restless leg syndrome, vivid dreams, acting out dreams, and the use of sleep medication are over-represented in patients with PD compared with matched healthy controls. Male sex and PD onset before the age of 50 were also associated with a greater risk of sleep problems. A physician diagnosis of insomnia was associated with more symptoms of depression, impairment of cognition-dependent independence, and a lower quality of life. Sleep problems were also associated with a higher prevalence of OFF periods compared with PD patients without sleep problems. 6.7% of PD patients endorsed sleep complaints as their most bothersome symptom, and reported non-specific poor sleep quality as the most common sleep problem. These patients also had a better quality of life and lower depression and cognitive impairments than patients for whom postural instability was their most bothersome symptom, indicating the relative burden of sleep problems is contextualised by the severity of motor symptoms. Overall, these findings reinforce the high prevalence of sleep problems in a very large sample of PD patients, and indicate important associations of sleep problems with daily function and quality of life in PD.

What Parkinson's disease patients say in their own words about their mood and anxiety symptoms.	OBJECTIVE: To understand what Parkinson's Disease (PD) patients report in their own words about their mood and anxiety problems using the Parkinson's Disease Patient Report of Problems (PD-PROP). METHODS: Patient-reported data from the PD-PROP (reporting most bothersome problems due to PD in their own words), Geriatric Depression Scale, MDS-UPDRS II, and the Euro-Q0L from the Fox Insight research database (https://foxinsight.michaeljfox.org/) were examined using cross-sectional comparisons and logistic regression analyses to characterize non-depressive mood symptoms and anxiety. RESULTS: We identified 21,487 participants who completed at least one PD-PROP questionnaire. Four categories of non-depressive mood symptoms (Anxiety/Worry, Loneliness/Isolation, Negative Emotions NOS (Not Otherwise Specified), Death/Suicidal Ideation) were identified. Women were much more likely than men to report non-depressive mood symptoms as a bothersome PD-related problem. The frequency of Anxiety/Worry reporting decreased with longer duration of PD while Loneliness/Isolation increased. More severe PD motor impairment, as measured by the MDS-UPDRS II, was associated with increased reporting of Negative Emotions and Loneliness/Isolation. Higher Euro-QoL, indicating better quality of life, was associated with decreased reporting of Loneliness/Isolation. Death/Suicidal Ideation was only reported by a small number of participants (<0.5 %). CONCLUSIONS: Women were more likely than men with PD to identify Anxiety/Worry, Negative Emotions, and Loneliness/Isolation as problems. This finding and the higher prevalence of bothersome loneliness/isolation as PD duration increases can guide monitoring for these issues.

Real-World Experiences of Parkinson's Disease OFF Time and Role of Demographics.	PURPOSE: OFF periods are episodes when Parkinson's disease (PD) medications work suboptimally, with symptoms returning and impacting quality of life. We aimed to characterize OFF periods using patient-reported frequency, severity, and duration, as well as determine these characteristics' associations with demographics. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study using Fox Insight Data Exploration Network (Fox DEN) database was conducted. Eligible patients had PD and were >18 years. The experience of OFF periods was characterized by frequency (number of episodes/day), duration (duration/episode), and severity (impact on activities). Significance level was Bonferroni-corrected for multivariate analyses. RESULTS: From a population of 6,757 persons with PD, 88% were non-Hispanic Whites (mean age: 66 ± 8.8 years); 52.7% were males versus 47.3% females; mean PD duration was 5.7 ± 5.2; and 51% experienced OFF periods. Subsequent analyses were limited to non-Hispanic Whites, as they constituted a large majority of the participants and were the subgroup that had the sample size to derive reliable inferences. The analyses showed that 67% experienced 1-2 episodes/day, 90% experienced >15-minute episodes, and 55% reported slight-mild severity/episode. Lower age was associated with a higher frequency (incidence rate ratio [IRR]: 0.992; P<0.001) and severity (odds ratio [OR]: 0.985; P=0.001) of OFF episodes. Income of <$35,000 was associated with 15.1% more episodes/day (IRR: 1.15, p<0.001) and 66.5% higher odds of a severe episode (OR: 1.66; P<0.001). Females experienced 7.5% more episodes compared to males (IRR: 1.075; P=0.003). Longer PD duration was associated with 1.3% more episodes/day (IRR: 1.013; P<0.001) and 10% higher odds of a severe episode (OR: 1.10; P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Lower age, income <$35,000, longer PD duration, female gender, and being unemployed are associated with a higher frequency and severity of OFF periods with no associations for duration/episode among non-Hispanic Whites with PD. In time-constrained clinic environments, clinicians should tailor OFF periods management counseling to vulnerable demographic groups to enhance care delivery.(	OFF periods; Parkinson’s disease; associations; demographics; risk factors

Mental health disparities and the role of perceived discrimination among Latinx individuals living with Parkinson's disease.	INTRODUCTION: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder with motor and non-motor symptoms including depression and cognitive impairment. There is underrepresentation of Latinxs in PD research as most of the research consists of non-Latinx white participants. The current study investigates longitudinal differences in health disparities among Latinx and White non-Latinx individuals living with PD. As a second aim, we examined the associations between perceived discrimination in healthcare and outcomes from aim 1. METHODS: The present study consisted of 25,298 individuals with PD who enrolled in the Fox Insight (FI) online study. Participants were followed annually for up to 3 years. Participants completed measures of depressive symptoms, health-related quality of life (HRQOL), cognitive complaints, subjective motor symptom severity, self-reported income, and perceived discrimination in healthcare. Multilevel models examined the longitudinal differences in non-motor and motor outcomes among Latinx (n = 1161) and White non-Latinx individuals (n = 24,137). RESULTS: Latinx participants reported significantly more depressive symptoms and worse HRQOL than non-Latinx individuals. No significant differences were found in cognitive complaints, or motor severity between Latinx and non-Latinx participants. The main effect of perceived discrimination was associated with both depressive symptoms and HRQOL. CONCLUSIONS: The current study provides initial evidence of mental health discrepancies among Latinx individuals living with PD and White non-Latinx counterparts. The combination of underrepresentation in research and possible health disparities among Latinx communities may affect the quality of clinical trials/studies and patient care.

Adjusting for Underrepresentation Reveals Widespread Underestimation of Parkinson's Disease Symptom Burden.	"BACKGROUND: Clinical research is limited by underrepresentation, but the impact of underrepresentation on patient-reported outcomes in Parkinson's disease (PD) is unknown. OBJECTIVES: To produce nationwide estimates of non-motor symptom (NMS) prevalence and PD-related quality of life (QOL) limitations while accounting for underrepresentation. METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional analysis of data from the Fox Insight (FI) study, an ongoing prospective longitudinal study of persons with self-reported PD. Using epidemiologic literature and United States (US) Census Bureau, Medicare, and National Health and Aging Trends Study data, we simulated a ""virtual census"" of the PD population. To compare the PD census to the FI cohort, we used logistic regression to model the odds of study participation and calculate predicted probabilities of participation for inverse probability weighting. RESULTS: There are an estimated 849,488 persons living with PD in the US. Compared to 22,465 eligible FI participants, non-participants are more likely to be older, female, and non-White; live in rural regions; have more severe PD; and have lower levels of education. When these predictors were incorporated into a multivariable regression model, predicted probability of participation was much higher for FI participants than non-participants, indicating a significant difference in the underlying populations (propensity score distance 2.62). Estimates of NMS prevalence and QOL limitation were greater when analyzed using inverse probability of participation weighting compared to unweighted means and frequencies. CONCLUSIONS: PD-related morbidity may be underestimated because of underrepresentation, and inverse probability of participation weighting can be used to give greater weight to underrepresented groups and produce more generalizable estimates. © 2023 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society."

Self-Image in Women with Parkinson's Disease.	There is a fundamental gap in knowledge in how Parkinson's disease manifests and affects women throughout their hormonal life cycle, resulting in unmet needs and adversely impacting women's quality of life. A set of questionnaires was developed and deployed through Fox Insight (open access) to address these issues by gathering data. This is the data from the first survey. The data from the questions regarding self-image were striking. 61% of women report that their Parkinson's disease negatively impacts their self-image. Here we explore the negative impact of Parkinson's disease on women to begin to fill the gaps in knowledge.

Cumulative Effect of Head Injuries on Nonmotor Outcomes in Parkinson's Disease.	OBJECTIVE: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative movement disorder that is a result of dopamine depletion in the basal ganglia. Individuals with a PD diagnosis experience motor symptoms (e.g., tremors) and nonmotor symptoms (e.g., cognitive decline). Previous studies suggest that progression of cognitive dysfunction in other neurologic populations can be predicted by cumulative head injuries. The study examined the association between lifelong number of head injuries and nonmotor outcomes (cognitive complaints, depression, and quality of life). METHODS: Participants consisted of 3,483 individuals with PD diagnoses who were enrolled in the Fox Insight study. Participants completed a self-report questionnaire to quantify the number of head injuries experienced throughout life. Participants also completed measures of nonmotor outcomes (cognitive complaints, depression, and quality of life) every 6 months over a 3-year period. RESULTS: Cognitive complaints were more common among those experiencing more head injuries. Further, more severe depression and greater difficulties in quality of life were reported among individuals experiencing a greater number of head injuries. Additional analyses revealed the effect between cognitive complaints and number of head injuries was driven by individuals who experienced five or more head injuries in their lifetime. CONCLUSIONS: Among individuals with PD, a patient report of past head injuries may have prognostic implications for important nonmotor outcomes. Report of multiple head injuries may be particularly concerning.	Parkinson’s disease; cognitive complaints; cumulative head injuries; depression; quality of life; traumatic brain injury

The Cost-Effective Price of Lecanemab for Patients with Early Alzheimer's Disease in Sweden.	INTRODUCTION: We sought to estimate the cost-effective price for lecanemab for treating early Alzheimer's disease in Sweden from the perspective of formal care payers. METHODS: We developed a Markov model with states defined by disease severity and care setting. The model was populated by integrated clinical and economic data from Swedish registers. We included patients with biomarker-confirmed Alzheimer's disease and fitted survival models for transitions between model states. Costs in 2023 Swedish kronor (SEK), life-years (LYs), and quality-adjusted LYs (QALYs) over a 10-year time horizon were estimated for standard of care and for lecanemab in addition to standard of care, assuming a maximum treatment duration of 3 years with lecanemab and no treatment effect after treatment stops. We also explored the impact of different assumptions regarding treatment efficacy and duration. RESULTS: Treatment with lecanemab over 3 years resulted in 0.13 LYs gained, 0.17 QALYs gained, and a net cost increase of 87,146 SEK (€1 = 11.5 SEK, $US1 = 10.6 SEK) due to administration and monitoring, before considering the cost of drug. The cost-effective price of lecanemab at a willingness-to-pay level of 1 million SEK per QALY was 33,886 SEK per year of treatment. The health gain, net costs, and cost-effective price of lecanemab varied significantly by treatment duration, potential residual effects, and patient characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: The future price of lecanemab in European countries is unknown. However, treatment with lecanemab is unlikely to be cost effective in Sweden at the levels of current list prices in the USA.

Potential Impact of Slowing Disease Progression in Early Symptomatic Alzheimer's Disease on Patient Quality of Life, Caregiver Time, and Total Societal Costs: Estimates Based on Findings from GERAS-US Study.	BACKGROUND: Impact of Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression on patient health-related quality of life (HRQoL), caregiver time, and societal costs is not well characterized in early AD. OBJECTIVE: To assess the association of change in cognition with HRQoL, caregiver time, and societal costs over 36 months, and estimate the impact of slowing disease progression on these outcomes. METHODS: This post-hoc analysis included patients with amyloid-positive mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and mild AD dementia (MILD AD) from the 36-month GERAS-US study. Disease progression was assessed using the Mini-Mental State Examination score. Change in outcomes associated with slowing AD progression was estimated using coefficients from generalized linear models. RESULTS: At baseline, 300 patients had MCI and 317 had MILD AD. Observed natural progression over 36 months was associated with: 5.1 point decline in the Bath Assessment of Subjective Quality of Life in Dementia (BASQID) score (for HRQoL), increase in 1,050 hours of total caregiver time, and $8,504 total societal costs for MCI; 6.6 point decline in the BASQID score, increase in 1,929 hours of total caregiver time, and $12,795 total societal costs for MILD AD per person. Slowing AD progression by 30% could result in per person savings in HRQoL decline, total caregiver time, and total societal costs: for MCI: 1.5 points, 315 hours, and $2,638; for MILD AD: 2.0 points, 579 hours, and $3,974. CONCLUSIONS: Slowing AD progression over 36 months could slow decline in HRQoL and save caregiver time and societal cost in patients with MCI and MILD AD.

Towards fair decentralized benchmarking of healthcare AI algorithms with the Federated Tumor Segmentation (FeTS) challenge.	Computational competitions are the standard for benchmarking medical image analysis algorithms, but they typically use small curated test datasets acquired at a few centers, leaving a gap to the reality of diverse multicentric patient data. To this end, the Federated Tumor Segmentation (FeTS) Challenge represents the paradigm for real-world algorithmic performance evaluation. The FeTS challenge is a competition to benchmark (i) federated learning aggregation algorithms and (ii) state-of-the-art segmentation algorithms, across multiple international sites. Weight aggregation and client selection techniques were compared using a multicentric brain tumor dataset in realistic federated learning simulations, yielding benefits for adaptive weight aggregation, and efficiency gains through client sampling. Quantitative performance evaluation of state-of-the-art segmentation algorithms on data distributed internationally across 32 institutions yielded good generalization on average, albeit the worst-case performance revealed data-specific modes of failure. Similar multi-site setups can help validate the real-world utility of healthcare AI algorithms in the future.

Mid- and later-life risk factors for predicting neuropathological brain changes associated with Alzheimer's and vascular dementia: The Honolulu Asia Aging Study and the Age, Gene/Environment Susceptibility-Reykjavik Study.	INTRODUCTION: Dementia prediction models are necessary to inform the development of dementia risk reduction strategies. Here, we examine the utility of neuropathological-based risk scores to predict clinical dementia. METHODS: Models were developed for predicting Alzheimer's disease (AD) and non-AD neuropathologies using the Honolulu Asia Aging neuropathological sub-study (HAAS; n = 852). Model accuracy for predicting clinical dementia, over 30 years, was tested in the non-autopsied HAAS sample (n = 2960) and the Age, Gene/Environment Susceptibility-Reykjavik Study (n = 4614). RESULTS: Different models were identified for predicting neurodegenerative and vascular neuropathology (c-statistic range: 0.62 to 0.72). These typically included age, APOE, and a blood pressure-related measure. The neurofibrillary tangle and micro-vascular lesion models showed good accuracy for predicting clinical vascular dementia. DISCUSSION: There may be shared risk factors across dementia-related lesions, suggesting common pathways. Strategies targeting these models may reduce risk or postpone clinical symptoms of dementia as well as reduce neuropathological burden associated with AD and vascular lesions.

Neighborhood deprivation and midlife cognition: Evidence of a modifiable vascular pathway involving health behaviors and cerebral small vessel disease.	INTRODUCTION: Neighborhood deprivation increases dementia risk, although mechanisms remain unclear. We tested a framework in which modifiable risk factors and cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) mediate the link between neighborhood deprivation and cognition. METHODS: In 585 cognitively healthy midlife adults (ages 40-59), neighborhood deprivation was derived from postcodes, cognition was assessed using the COGNITO, lifestyle risk factors were measured using clinical assessments, and SVD (white matter hyperintensities, lacunes, microbleeds, perivascular spaces) was assessed on 3T magnetic resonance imaging. Multivariate analyses examined association pathways among these variables. RESULTS: Neighborhood deprivation was associated with poorer cognition (r = 0.36, p < 0.001), greater prevalence of modifiable risk factors (r = 0.36, p < 0.001), and greater SVD burden (β = 0.18, p = 0.008). Serial mediation showed that the effects of deprivation on cognition were indirect, possibly operating via lifestyle risk and SVD, explaining 20% of the total effect, whereas SVD alone explained 28%. DISCUSSION: Neighborhood disadvantage relates to poorer cognition, possibly mediated through vascular risk factors and cerebrovascular disease. HIGHLIGHTS: Neighborhood deprivation linked to poorer cognition in healthy midlife adults Deprivation linked to small vessel disease (SVD) and modifiable risk factors (chiefly cardiovascular risk) Association between deprivation and cognition mediated by modifiable risk and SVD Mediation was exclusive to hypertensive SVD, but not cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA)-related SVD.	brain health disparities; cerebral small vessel disease; dementia prevention; midlife cognition; modifiable risk factors; neighborhood deprivation; structural determinants of health; vascular cognitive impairment

Alzheimer and cardiovascular genetic scores and cognition: the FINGER randomized controlled trial.	Alzheimer's disease and coronary artery disease are common late-life chronic conditions and share multiple risk factors, including Apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 allele. A meta-analysis of two multidomain lifestyle intervention trials indicated more cognitive benefit in APOE4 carriers compared with non-carriers. This study investigated the impact of genetic risk scores for Alzheimer's disease and coronary artery disease (AD-GRS, CAD-GRS) on cognition in the Finnish Geriatric Intervention Study to Prevent Cognitive Impairment and Disability (FINGER) randomized controlled trial. FINGER included 1259 at-risk individuals without dementia from the general population, aged 60-77 years. Participants were randomized 1:1 to 2-year multidomain lifestyle intervention or regular health advice. Primary outcome was change in cognition based on a modified Neuropsychological Test Battery (14 tests). Previous comprehensive AD-GRS and CAD-GRS were calculated using GWAS data (1,177 participants with 585 in control and 592 in intervention group, exploratory analysis). The intervention-control difference in annual overall cognition change (95% CI) for participants with AD-GRS above/below the median (i.e., higher/lower risk) was 0·032 (0·002-0·063) versus 0·017 (-0·011- 0·045), and for CAD-GRS above/below the median was 0·031 (0·002-0·059) versus 0·016 (-0·012-0·044). AD-GRS or CAD-GRS were not significantly related to the intervention effect overall (p>0·46), but for AD-GRS there were differences between women and men (p=0·024). The intervention-control difference in annual overall score change was 0·045 (0·004-0·087) for higher-risk women, 0·003 (-0·040-0·047) for lower-risk women, 0·019 (-0·026-0·064) for higher-risk men, and 0·027 (-0·009-0·064) for lower-risk men. People with genetic susceptibility for Alzheimer's disease/dementia or coronary artery disease can benefit from multidomain lifestyle interventions. Although the findings for AD-GRS and CAD-GRS risk groups were similar to APOE4 carrier status, with additional gender differences for AD-GRS, these exploratory findings need to be verified across several multidomain lifestyle trials to ensure adequate statistical power and inclusion of genetically diverse populations.

A clinician implementation protocol for BetterBrains: An online, person-centred risk factor management program to prevent cognitive decline.	OBJECTIVE: Modifiable risk factors, particularly those in midlife, can contribute to cognitive decline and dementia. Despite this, the 'how' of dementia risk reduction, including the application of interventional and care frameworks to deliver such a program is lacking. Our aim was to describe the 'how' in clinical delivery of a dementia risk reduction program called BetterBrains. METHODS: BetterBrains is an online, person-centred risk factor management program designed to prevent or delay cognitive decline in cognitively unimpaired community-dwelling, middle-aged adults with a family history of dementia. This protocol describes the delivery and implementation of BetterBrains using the Exploration, Preparation, Implementation, Sustainment (EPIS) framework. RESULTS: Procedures for risk factor assessment and tailored management pathways using motivational interviewing, nationwide community linkage mapping and community referral pathways using digital delivery are outlined. Coach training and competency checks for program fidelity measures are also described. CONCLUSION: Complex, multi-component programs require detailed implementation processes. Clinicians delivering BetterBrains may be better supported through standardised operating procedures, training and monitoring of competencies and implementation fidelity.

Differences in cognitive function at 18 y of age explain the association between low education and early dementia risk.	Major initiatives attempt to prevent dementia by targeting modifiable risk factors. Low education is frequently pointed to, due to its relationship with dementia. Impact of education is difficult to assess, however, because of associations with multiple other factors, requiring large population-representative samples to tease the relationships apart. We studied 207,814 Norwegian men born between 1950 and 1959 who underwent compulsory cognitive testing during military conscription as young adults, to systematically test associations of education, cognition, and other important factors. Participants were grouped into five education levels and seven cognitive levels. A total of 1,521 were diagnosed with dementia between ages 60 and 69 y. While having compulsory education only was associated with increased risk (Hazard ratio [HR] = 1.37, CI: 1.17 to 1.60), this association was markedly attenuated when controlling for cognitive test scores (HR = 1.08, CI: 0.91 to 1.28). In contrast, low cognitive score was associated with double risk of later diagnosis, even when controlling for education (HR = 2.00, CI: 1.65 to 2.42). This relationship survived controlling for early-life socioeconomic status and replicated within pairs of brothers. This suggests that genetic and environmental factors shared within families, e.g., common genetics, parental education, socioeconomic status, or other shared experiences, cannot account for the association. Rather, independent, nonfamilial factors are more important. In contrast, within-family factors accounted for the relationship between low education and diagnosis risk. In conclusion, implementing measures to increase cognitive function in childhood and adolescence appears to be a more promising strategy for reducing dementia burden.	cognition; dementia; education

Programme Dementia Prevention (pdp): A Nationwide Program for Personalized Prevention in Luxembourg.	"BACKGROUND: With continuously aging societies, an increase in the number of people with cognitive decline is to be expected. Aside from the development of causative treatments, the successful implementation of prevention strategies is of utmost importance to reduce the high societal burden caused by neurodegenerative diseases leading to dementia among which the most common cause is Alzheimer's disease. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the Luxembourgish ""programme dementia prevention (pdp)"" is to prevent or at least delay dementia in an at-risk population through personalized multi-domain lifestyle interventions. The current work aims to provide a detailed overview of the methodology and presents initial results regarding the cohort characteristics and the implementation process. METHODS: In the frame of the pdp, an extensive neuropsychological evaluation and risk factor assessment are conducted for each participant. Based on the results, individualized multi-domain lifestyle interventions are suggested. RESULTS: A total number of 450 participants (Mean age = 69.5 years; SD = 10.8) have been screened at different recruitment sites throughout the country, among whom 425 participants (94.4%) met the selection criteria. CONCLUSIONS: We provide evidence supporting the feasibility of implementing a nationwide dementia prevention program and achieving successful recruitment of the target population by establishing a network of different healthcare providers."

Protocol for the Brain Health Support Program Study of the Canadian Therapeutic Platform Trial for Multidomain Interventions to Prevent Dementia (CAN-THUMBS UP): A Prospective 12-Month Intervention Study.	BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: CAN-THUMBS UP is designed as a comprehensive and innovative fully remote program to 1) develop an interactive and compelling online Brain Health Support Program intervention, with potential to positively influence dementia literacy, self-efficacy and lifestyle risk factors; 2) enroll and retain a community-dwelling Platform Trial Cohort of individuals at risk of dementia who will participate in the intervention; 3) support an open platform trial to test a variety of multidomain interventions that might further benefit individuals at risk of dementia. This manuscript presents the Brain Health Support Program Study protocol. DESIGN/SETTING: Twelve-month prospective multi-center longitudinal study to evaluate a fully remote web-based educational intervention. Participants will subsequently be part of a Platform Trial Cohort and may be eligible to participate in further dementia prevention clinical trials. PARTICIPANTS: Three hundred fifty older adults who are cognitively unimpaired or have mild cognitive impairment, with at least 1 well established dementia risk factor. INTERVENTION: Participants engage in the Brain Health Support Program intervention for 45-weeks and complete pre/post intervention measures. This intervention is designed to convey best available evidence for dementia prevention, consists of 181 chapters within 8 modules that are progressively delivered, and is available online in English and French. The program has been developed as a collaborative effort by investigators with recognized expertise in the program's content areas, along with input from older-adult citizen advisors. MEASUREMENTS: This study utilizes adapted remote assessments with accessible technologies (e.g. videoconferencing, cognitive testing via computer and mobile phone, wearable devices to track physical activity and sleep, self-administered saliva sample collection). The primary outcome is change in dementia literacy, as measured by the Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Scale. Secondary outcomes include change in self-efficacy; engagement using the online program; user satisfaction ratings; and evaluation of usability and acceptance. Exploratory outcomes include changes in attitudes toward dementia, modifiable risk factors, performance on the Neuropsychological Test Battery, performance on self-administered online cognitive assessments, and levels of physical activity and sleep; success of the national recruitment plan; and the distribution of age adjusted polygenic hazard scores. CONCLUSIONS: This fully remote study provides an accessible approach to research with all study activities being completed in the participants' home environment. This approach may reduce barriers to participation, provide an easier and less demanding participant experience, and reach a broader geography with recruitment from all regions of Canada. CAN-THUMBS UP represents a Canadian contribution to the global World-Wide FINGERS program (alz.org/wwfingers).	Alzheimer’s disease; Brain Health PRO; NCT05347966; dementia; prevention

Testing times for dementia: a community survey identifying contemporary barriers to risk reduction and screening.	BACKGROUND: Advances in pharmacological and non-pharmacological dementia interventions may mean future dementia prevention incorporates a combination of targeted screening and lifestyle modifications. Elucidating potential barriers which may prevent community engagement with dementia prevention initiatives is important to maximise the accessibility and feasibility of these initiatives across the lifespan. METHODS: Six hundred seven adults aged over 18 years completed a 54-item, multiple-choice survey exploring contemporary attitudes towards, and barriers to, dementia risk reduction and screening relative to other common health conditions. Participants were sourced from Australia's largest, paid, data analytics service (ORIMA). RESULTS: Finances (p = .009), poor motivation (p = .043), and time (p ≤ .0001) emerged as significant perceived barriers to dementia risk reduction behaviours. Lack of time was more likely to be reported by younger, relative to older, participants (p ≤ .0001), while females were more likely than males to report financial (p = .019) and motivational (p = .043) factors. Binary logistic regression revealed willingness to undertake dementia testing modalities was significantly influenced by gender (genetic testing, p = .012; saliva, p = .038, modifiable risk factors p = .003), age (cognitive testing, p ≤ .0001; blood, p = .010), and socio-economic group (retinal imaging, p = .042; modifiable risk-factor screening, p = .019). Over 65% of respondents felt adequately informed about risk reduction for at least one non-dementia health condition, compared to 30.5% for dementia. CONCLUSIONS: This study found perceived barriers to dementia risk reduction behaviours, and the willingness to engage in various dementia testing modalities, was significantly associated with socio-demographic factors across the lifespan. These findings provide valuable insight regarding the accessibility and feasibility of potential methods for identifying those most at risk of developing dementia, as well as the need to better promote and support wide-scale engagement in dementia risk reduction behaviours across the lifespan.

Repurposing nirogacestat, a gamma secretase enzyme inhibitor in desmoid tumors.	The gamma secretase (GS) enzyme controls cell-cell adhesion, neural stem cell proliferation, neo-angiogenesis, spinal maturation, and metabolism of amyloid precursor proteins (APP). Pathological production of abnormal amyloid-beta isoforms and senile plaques serves as the basis for pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). GS enzyme inhibitors such as semagacestat and avagacestat were explored in AD but the studies were paused because of adverse events attributed to their influence on the Notch pathway.Crosstalk between Notch and Wnt signaling pathways created a potential role for GS inhibitors in the treatment of malignancies such as glioblastoma multiforme, pancreatic, and breast cancers. In a phase I study on nirogacestat among refractory solid malignancies, overall response rate (ORR) of 71.4% was observed in desmoid tumor (DT). The pivotal DeFi phase III trial established superiority of nirogacestat in terms of progression-free survival and ORR, reducing the likelihood of progression by 71%. Emphasis was placed on patient-reported outcomes (PRO) including the DT-specific tool, GOunder/Desmoid Tumor Research Foundation DEsmoid Symptom Scale (GODDESS).Nirogacestat received Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval in November 2023 and European Commission approval in August 2025 for adults with progressing desmoid tumors (DT) who require systemic treatment. Further studies are underway to investigate other GS inhibitors such as AL-102 in the management of DT. The role of the enzyme gamma secretase (GS) was discovered in various processes of adhesion between various cells, formation of blood vessels and development of new nerve systems. This enzyme has been found to have a role in the onset and worsening of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), which is a type of dementia. Some clinical trials examined if GS-inhibiting drugs could help in the treatment of AD but were not pursued further due to significant side effects. However, in another study, it was discovered that the same class of medications was able to act against the rare disease known as desmoid tumor (DT). One of these drugs, nirogacestat, was initially examined in a small study which included patients with various cancers, including DT. The patients in this study had different types of cancers which had failed previous treatments. Among these patients, those with DT experienced good treatment outcome with 71.4% showing reduction in size of the tumor using nirogacestat. Being a rare disease, conducting trials with a greater number of patients was difficult in DT because of various reasons such as patients being scattered across countries, doctors being unaware of treatment options and the lesser efforts from the pharmaceutical industry. The patient advocacy group Desmoid Tumor Research Foundation (DTRF) came to the fore to help overcome these difficulties and act as a platform for the patients and physicians to help in collaborations and conduct further studies. Encouraging findings were obtained and finally the pivotal clinical trial (DeFi study) which demonstrated that nirogacestat was a new, superior treatment option for DT. Nirogacestat also improved the quality of life of the enrolled patients, which is an important factor in chronic diseases such as DT. The results of this study paved the way for the Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) approval of nirogacestat in the management of DT. We present the journey of these GS inhibitors, from the biological aspect to its role in the treatment of DT.	Desmoid; drug development; gamma secretase inhibitor; patient advocacy; rare tumors

Bioinformatics analysis of the potential receptor and therapeutic drugs for Alzheimer's disease with comorbid Parkinson's disease.	BACKGROUND: Now, there are no sensitive biomarkers for improving Alzheimer's disease (AD) and comorbid Parkinson's disease (PD). The aim of the present study was to analyze differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in brain tissue from AD and PD patients via bioinformatics analysis, as well as to explore precise diagnostic and therapeutic targets for AD and comorbid PD. METHODS: GFE122063 and GSE7621 data sets from GEO in NCBI, were used to screen differentially expressed genes (DEGs) for AD and PD, and identify the intersected genes, respectively. Intersected genes were analyzed by Gene Ontology (GO) analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis. Then, STRING site and Cytoscape were used to construct a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, CytoNCA algorithm to analyze and evaluate centrality, Mcode plug-in to analyze module, and Cytohubba to screen key genes. Combined GO-KEGG enrichment analysis with Cytoscape algorithm to screen the key gene in AD complicated with PD. Then, the DEGs for AD and PD were imported into the Association Map (CMap) online platform to screen out the top 10 small molecule drugs, and using molecular docking techniques to evaluate the interactions between small molecule drugs and key genes receptors. RESULTS: In total, 231 upregulated genes and 300 downregulated genes were identified. GO analysis revealed that the DEGs were highly enriched in signal transduction, and KEGG analysis revealed that the DEGs were associated with the MAPK and PI3K-Akt signaling pathways. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) was identified as a potential receptor gene in AD and comorbid PD. EGFR was upregulated in both AD and PD, and the proteins that interact with EGFR were enriched in the Ras/Raf/MAPK and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways. Semagacestat was identified as a drug with therapeutic potential for treating AD complicated with PD. There was a high binding affinity between semagacestat and EGFR DISCUSSION: Semagacestat may improve the health of patients with AD complicated with PD through the regulation of the Ras/Raf/MAPK and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways by EGFR, providing evidence supporting the structural modification of semagacestat to develop a more effective drug for treating AD complicated with PD.

Associations of socioeconomic status and healthy lifestyle with incident dementia and cognitive decline: two prospective cohort studies.	BACKGROUND: Little is known about the complex associations of socioeconomic status (SES) and healthy lifestyle with cognitive dysfunction. METHODS: Using data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) [2008-2020] and the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA) [2004-2018], SES was constructed by latent class analysis using education level, total household income and wealth. Overall healthy lifestyle was derived using information on never smoking, low to moderate alcohol consumption (drinks/day: (0, 1] for women and (0, 2] for men), top tertile of physical activity, and active social contact. FINDINGS: A total of 12,437 and 6565 participants from the HRS and ELSA were included (40.8% and 46.0% men and mean age 69.3 years and 65.1 years, respectively). Compared with participants of high SES, those of low SES had higher risk of incident dementia (hazard ratio 3.17, 95% confidence interval 2.72-3.69 in the HRS; 1.43, 1.09-1.86 in the ELSA), and the proportions mediated by overall lifestyle were 10.4% (7.3%-14.6%) and 2.7% (0.5%-14.0%), respectively. Compared with participants of high SES and favorable lifestyle, those with low SES and unfavorable lifestyle had a higher risk of incident dementia (4.27, 3.40-5.38 in the HRS; 2.02, 1.25-3.27 in the ELSA) and accelerated rate of global cognitive decline ( INTERPRETATION: Unhealthy lifestyle only mediated a small proportion of the socioeconomic inequality in dementia risk in both US and UK older adults.

High-sensitivity cardiac troponin I and risk of dementia: the 25-year longitudinal Whitehall II study.	BACKGROUND AND AIMS: This study hypothesizes that subclinical myocardial injury during midlife, indexed by increases in cardiac troponin I, is associated with accelerated cognitive decline, smaller structural brain volume, and higher risk of dementia. METHODS: Overall, 5985 participants in the Whitehall II study, aged 45-69 who had cardiac troponin I measured by a high-sensitivity assay at baseline (1997-99), were followed until March 2023. The outcome measure was incident dementia; cognitive testing was performed at six waves; and neuroimaging metrics were obtained from magnetic resonance imaging scans in 2012-16. Cox model and linear mixed model were used to examine the association of cardiac troponin with incident dementia and cognitive trajectory. A nested case-control sample of 3475 participants (695 dementia cases and 2780 matched controls) was used for backward trajectory analysis for cardiac troponin, measured at three waves (1997-99, 2007-09, 2012-13). RESULTS: A total of 606 (10.1%) cases of dementia were recorded over a median follow-up of 24.8 years. Doubling of cardiac troponin was associated with 10% (95% confidence interval 3%-17%) higher risk of dementia. Participants with increased cardiac troponin at baseline had a faster decline of cognitive function. Participants with dementia had increased cardiac troponin concentrations compared with those without dementia between 7 and 25 years before diagnosis. Compared with those with cardiac troponin levels < 2.5 ng/L at baseline, those with concentrations > 5.2 ng/L had lower grey matter volume and higher hippocampal atrophy 15 years later, equivalent to ageing effects of 2.7 and 3 years, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Subclinical myocardial injury at midlife was associated with higher dementia risk in later life.	Cognitive decline; Dementia; Myocardial injury; Troponin

High-sensitivity cardiac troponin I and risk of dementia: 25-year longitudinal study in the Whitehall II cohort.	OBJECTIVE: We hypothesise that subclinical myocardial injury during midlife, indexed by increases in cardiac troponin I, is associated with accelerated cognitive decline, smaller structural brain volume, and higher risk of dementia. DESIGN: Longitudinal cohort study. SETTING: Civil service departments in London (Whitehall II study). PARTICIPANTS: 5985 participants aged 45-69 had cardiac troponin I measured by high-sensitivity assay at baseline (1997-99) for prospective cohort analyses. A nested case-control sample of 3475 participants (695 dementia cases and 2780 matched controls) was used for backward cardiac troponin I trajectory analysis. 641 participants provided magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans for brain volume analysis. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incident dementia cases were ascertained from national hospital episode statistics, mental health and mortality registers until 2023. Cognitive testing was performed at six waves over 25 years (1997-99, 2002-04, 2007-09, 2012-13, 2015-16, 2019-22). Brain volume metrics were derived from structural MRI scans (2012-16). RESULTS: For prospective cohort analyses, 606 (10.1%) incident cases of dementia were recorded over a median follow-up of 24.8 years. Doubling of cardiac troponin was associated with 11% higher risk of dementia (HR=1.11, 95% CI: 1.04 to 1.19). Participants with increased cardiac troponin at baseline had a faster decline of cognitive function with age. Compared to participants with concentrations below the limit of quantitation (<2.5 ng/L), those in the upper third (>5.2 ng/L) had similar global cognitive z score at age 60, but had 0.10 (95% CI: 0.02 to 0.18) standard deviations lower score at age 80, and 0.19 (0.03 to 0.35) standard deviations lower score at age 90. Participants with dementia had increased cardiac troponin concentrations compared with those without dementia between 7 and 25 years before diagnosis. Compared to those with low cardiac troponin level (<2.5 ng/L at baseline) those with concentrations >5.2 ng/L had lower grey matter volume and higher hippocampal atrophy 15 years later, equivalent to ageing effects of 2.7 and 3 years, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Subclinical myocardial injury at midlife was associated with higher dementia risk in later life.

[Glymphatic dysfunction and sleep disorders: indirect effects on Alzheimer's disease].	Modern research raises the question of the potentially significant role of glymphatic dysfunction in the development of neurodegeneration and pathological aging. The exact molecular mechanisms are not yet fully understood, but there is ample evidence of a link between sleep deprivation and decreased clearance of β-amyloid and other neurotoxin proteins that are associated with the development of neurodegenerative diseases, particularly Alzheimer's disease. The review analyzes current scientific information in this area of research, describes the latest scientific discoveries of the features of the glymphatic system, and also illustrates studies of markers that presumably indicate a deterioration in the glymphatic system. The relationship between sleep deprivation and pathophysiological mechanisms associated with neurodegenerative diseases is considered, and potential targets that can be used to treat or delay the development of these disorders are noted. В современных исследованиях поднимается вопрос о потенциально значимой роли глимфатической дисфункции в развитии процессов нейродегенерации и патологического старения. Точные молекулярные механизмы еще не до конца известны, однако существует большое количество данных о связи между депривацией сна и снижением выведения β-амилоида и других белков-нейротоксинов, которые ассоциированы с развитием нейродегенеративных заболеваний, в частности болезни Альцгеймера. В обзоре проанализирована актуальная научная информация в данной области исследований, описаны новейшие научные открытия особенностей глимфатической системы, а также проиллюстрированы исследования маркеров, которые, предположительно, являются указанием на ухудшение работы глимфатической системы. Рассмотрена связь между депривацией сна и патофизиологическими механизмами, связанными с нейродегенеративными заболеваниями, а также отмечены потенциальные мишени, которые могут быть использованы для лечения или задержки развития данных расстройств.

Machine learning-based proteomics profiling of ALS identifies downregulation of RPS29 that maintains protein homeostasis and STMN2 level.	Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating motor neuron disease. The molecular understanding of ALS is hampered by the lack of experimental models recapitulating disease heterogeneity and analytical framework integrating multi-omics datasets. Here, we developed a pipeline integrating machine learning and consensus clustering to analyze a large-scale dataset of patient-derived motor neuron models from Answer ALS. Compared to the transcriptome, proteomic profiling closely correlates with ALS pathology, which is interrogated to identify 110 proteomics-based biomarkers (Proteomics Markers for ALS 110, PMA110). Functional enrichment highlights dysregulation of ALS pathways, including protein translation and neuronal function. By integrating ALS subtype-specific proteins with patient postmortem proteomics, we found that RPS29 was consistently downregulated in ALS models and patient motor neurons. RPS29 is required for neuronal viability by maintaining ribosome profiling and accurate translation, and suppressing pathological translation. RPS29 downregulation suppresses translation of STMN2, an essential protein for motor neurons, in iPSC-derived motor neurons. Taken together, this study provides a robust framework for ALS proteomics, identifies RPS29 as a quality controller of protein translation, and presents a translational mechanism for STMN2 maintenance in ALS.

Disease related changes in ATAC-seq of iPSC-derived motor neuron lines from ALS patients and controls.	Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), like many other neurodegenerative diseases, is highly heritable, but with only a small fraction of cases explained by monogenic disease alleles. To better understand sporadic ALS, we report epigenomic profiles, as measured by ATAC-seq, of motor neuron cultures derived from a diverse group of 380 ALS patients and 80 healthy controls. We find that chromatin accessibility is heavily influenced by sex, the iPSC cell type of origin, ancestry, and the inherent variance arising from sequencing. Once these covariates are corrected for, we are able to identify ALS-specific signals in the data. Additionally, we find that the ATAC-seq data is able to predict ALS disease progression rates with similar accuracy to methods based on biomarkers and clinical status. These results suggest that iPSC-derived motor neurons recapitulate important disease-relevant epigenomic changes.

Identification of gene fusions associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.	INTRODUCTION/AIMS: Genetics is an important risk factor for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a neurodegenerative disease affecting motor neurons. Recent findings demonstrate that in addition to specific genetic mutations, structural variants caused by genetic instability can also play a causative role in ALS. Genomic instability can lead to deletions, duplications, insertions, inversions, and translocations in the genome, and these changes can sometimes lead to fusion of distinct genes into a single transcript. Gene fusion events have been studied extensively in cancer; however, they have not been thoroughly investigated in ALS. The aim of this study was to determine whether gene fusions are present in ALS. METHODS: Gene fusions were identified using STAR Fusion v1.10.0 software in bulk RNA-Seq data from human postmortem samples from publicly available data sets from Target ALS and the New York Genome Center ALS Consortium. RESULTS: We report the presence of gene fusion events in several brain regions as well as in spinal cord samples in ALS. Although most gene fusions were intra-chromosomal events between neighboring genes and present in both ALS and control samples, there was a significantly greater number of unique gene fusions in ALS compared to controls. Lastly, we identified specific gene fusions with a significant burden in ALS, that were absent from both control samples and known cancer gene fusion databases. DISCUSSION: Collectively, our findings reveal an enrichment of gene fusions in ALS and suggest that these events may be an additional genetic cause linked to ALS pathogenesis.

The Caerphilly Prospective Study	CaPS	Cardiovascular Disease; Dementia; Aging	[clinical, longitudinal] Population cohort; Cardiovascular risk; Cognitive function; Quality of life	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMCPMC12535838/			Global burden of 292 causes of death in 204 countries and territories and 660 subnational locations, 1990-2023: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2023.	BACKGROUND: Timely and comprehensive analyses of causes of death stratified by age, sex, and location are essential for shaping effective health policies aimed at reducing global mortality. The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2023 provides cause-specific mortality estimates measured in counts, rates, and years of life lost (YLLs). GBD 2023 aimed to enhance our understanding of the relationship between age and cause of death by quantifying the probability of dying before age 70 years (70q0) and the mean age at death by cause and sex. This study enables comparisons of the impact of causes of death over time, offering a deeper understanding of how these causes affect global populations. METHODS: GBD 2023 produced estimates for 292 causes of death disaggregated by age-sex-location-year in 204 countries and territories and 660 subnational locations for each year from 1990 until 2023. We used a modelling tool developed for GBD, the Cause of Death Ensemble model (CODEm), to estimate cause-specific death rates for most causes. We computed YLLs as the product of the number of deaths for each cause-age-sex-location-year and the standard life expectancy at each age. Probability of death was calculated as the chance of dying from a given cause in a specific age period, for a specific population. Mean age at death was calculated by first assigning the midpoint age of each age group for every death, followed by computing the mean of all midpoint ages across all deaths attributed to a given cause. We used GBD death estimates to calculate the observed mean age at death and to model the expected mean age across causes, sexes, years, and locations. The expected mean age reflects the expected mean age at death for individuals within a population, based on global mortality rates and the population's age structure. Comparatively, the observed mean age represents the actual mean age at death, influenced by all factors unique to a location-specific population, including its age structure. As part of the modelling process, uncertainty intervals (UIs) were generated using the 2·5th and 97·5th percentiles from a 250-draw distribution for each metric. Findings are reported as counts and age-standardised rates. Methodological improvements for cause-of-death estimates in GBD 2023 include a correction for the misclassification of deaths due to COVID-19, updates to the method used to estimate COVID-19, and updates to the CODEm modelling framework. This analysis used 55 761 data sources, including vital registration and verbal autopsy data as well as data from surveys, censuses, surveillance systems, and cancer registries, among others. For GBD 2023, there were 312 new country-years of vital registration cause-of-death data, 3 country-years of surveillance data, 51 country-years of verbal autopsy data, and 144 country-years of other data types that were added to those used in previous GBD rounds. FINDINGS: The initial years of the COVID-19 pandemic caused shifts in long-standing rankings of the leading causes of global deaths: it ranked as the number one age-standardised cause of death at Level 3 of the GBD cause classification hierarchy in 2021. By 2023, COVID-19 dropped to the 20th place among the leading global causes, returning the rankings of the leading two causes to those typical across the time series (ie, ischaemic heart disease and stroke). While ischaemic heart disease and stroke persist as leading causes of death, there has been progress in reducing their age-standardised mortality rates globally. Four other leading causes have also shown large declines in global age-standardised mortality rates across the study period: diarrhoeal diseases, tuberculosis, stomach cancer, and measles. Other causes of death showed disparate patterns between sexes, notably for deaths from conflict and terrorism in some locations. A large reduction in age-standardised rates of YLLs occurred for neonatal disorders. Despite this, neonatal disorders remained the leading cause of global YLLs over the period studied, except in 2021, when COVID-19 was temporarily the leading cause. Compared to 1990, there has been a considerable reduction in total YLLs in many vaccine-preventable diseases, most notably diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, and measles. In addition, this study quantified the mean age at death for all-cause mortality and cause-specific mortality and found noticeable variation by sex and location. The global all-cause mean age at death increased from 46·8 years (95% UI 46·6-47·0) in 1990 to 63·4 years (63·1-63·7) in 2023. For males, mean age increased from 45·4 years (45·1-45·7) to 61·2 years (60·7-61·6), and for females it increased from 48·5 years (48·1-48·8) to 65·9 years (65·5-66·3), from 1990 to 2023. The highest all-cause mean age at death in 2023 was found in the high-income super-region, where the mean age for females reached 80·9 years (80·9-81·0) and for males 74·8 years (74·8-74·9). By comparison, the lowest all-cause mean age at death occurred in sub-Saharan Africa, where it was 38·0 years (37·5-38·4) for females and 35·6 years (35·2-35·9) for males in 2023. Lastly, our study found that all-cause 70q0 decreased across each GBD super-region and region from 2000 to 2023, although with large variability between them. For females, we found that 70q0 notably increased from drug use disorders and conflict and terrorism. Leading causes that increased 70q0 for males also included drug use disorders, as well as diabetes. In sub-Saharan Africa, there was an increase in 70q0 for many non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Additionally, the mean age at death from NCDs was lower than the expected mean age at death for this super-region. By comparison, there was an increase in 70q0 for drug use disorders in the high-income super-region, which also had an observed mean age at death lower than the expected value. INTERPRETATION: We examined global mortality patterns over the past three decades, highlighting-with enhanced estimation methods-the impacts of major events such as the COVID-19 pandemic, in addition to broader trends such as increasing NCDs in low-income regions that reflect ongoing shifts in the global epidemiological transition. This study also delves into premature mortality patterns, exploring the interplay between age and causes of death and deepening our understanding of where targeted resources could be applied to further reduce preventable sources of mortality. We provide essential insights into global and regional health disparities, identifying locations in need of targeted interventions to address both communicable and non-communicable diseases. There is an ever-present need for strengthened health-care systems that are resilient to future pandemics and the shifting burden of disease, particularly among ageing populations in regions with high mortality rates. Robust estimates of causes of death are increasingly essential to inform health priorities and guide efforts toward achieving global health equity. The need for global collaboration to reduce preventable mortality is more important than ever, as shifting burdens of disease are affecting all nations, albeit at different paces and scales.

The Caerphilly Prospective Study	CaPS	Cardiovascular Disease; Dementia; Aging	[clinical, longitudinal] Population cohort; Cardiovascular risk; Cognitive function; Quality of life	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMCPMC12535840/			Burden of 375 diseases and injuries, risk-attributable burden of 88 risk factors, and healthy life expectancy in 204 countries and territories, including 660 subnational locations, 1990-2023: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2023.	BACKGROUND: For more than three decades, the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) has provided a framework to quantify health loss due to diseases, injuries, and associated risk factors. This paper presents GBD 2023 findings on disease and injury burden and risk-attributable health loss, offering a global audit of the state of world health to inform public health priorities. This work captures the evolving landscape of health metrics across age groups, sexes, and locations, while reflecting on the remaining post-COVID-19 challenges to achieving our collective global health ambitions. METHODS: The GBD 2023 combined analysis estimated years lived with disability (YLDs), years of life lost (YLLs), and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) for 375 diseases and injuries, and risk-attributable burden associated with 88 modifiable risk factors. Of the more than 310 000 total data sources used for all GBD 2023 (about 30% of which were new to this estimation round), more than 120 000 sources were used for estimation of disease and injury burden and 59 000 for risk factor estimation, and included vital registration systems, surveys, disease registries, and published scientific literature. Data were analysed using previously established modelling approaches, such as disease modelling meta-regression version 2.1 (DisMod-MR 2.1) and comparative risk assessment methods. Diseases and injuries were categorised into four levels on the basis of the established GBD cause hierarchy, as were risk factors using the GBD risk hierarchy. Estimates stratified by age, sex, location, and year from 1990 to 2023 were focused on disease-specific time trends over the 2010-23 period and presented as counts (to three significant figures) and age-standardised rates per 100 000 person-years (to one decimal place). For each measure, 95% uncertainty intervals [UIs] were calculated with the 2·5th and 97·5th percentile ordered values from a 250-draw distribution. FINDINGS: Total numbers of global DALYs grew 6·1% (95% UI 4·0-8·1), from 2·64 billion (2·46-2·86) in 2010 to 2·80 billion (2·57-3·08) in 2023, but age-standardised DALY rates, which account for population growth and ageing, decreased by 12·6% (11·0-14·1), revealing large long-term health improvements. Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) contributed 1·45 billion (1·31-1·61) global DALYs in 2010, increasing to 1·80 billion (1·63-2·03) in 2023, alongside a concurrent 4·1% (1·9-6·3) reduction in age-standardised rates. Based on DALY counts, the leading level 3 NCDs in 2023 were ischaemic heart disease (193 million [176-209] DALYs), stroke (157 million [141-172]), and diabetes (90·2 million [75·2-107]), with the largest increases in age-standardised rates since 2010 occurring for anxiety disorders (62·8% [34·0-107·5]), depressive disorders (26·3% [11·6-42·9]), and diabetes (14·9% [7·5-25·6]). Remarkable health gains were made for communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional (CMNN) diseases, with DALYs falling from 874 million (837-917) in 2010 to 681 million (642-736) in 2023, and a 25·8% (22·6-28·7) reduction in age-standardised DALY rates. During the COVID-19 pandemic, DALYs due to CMNN diseases rose but returned to pre-pandemic levels by 2023. From 2010 to 2023, decreases in age-standardised rates for CMNN diseases were led by rate decreases of 49·1% (32·7-61·0) for diarrhoeal diseases, 42·9% (38·0-48·0) for HIV/AIDS, and 42·2% (23·6-56·6) for tuberculosis. Neonatal disorders and lower respiratory infections remained the leading level 3 CMNN causes globally in 2023, although both showed notable rate decreases from 2010, declining by 16·5% (10·6-22·0) and 24·8% (7·4-36·7), respectively. Injury-related age-standardised DALY rates decreased by 15·6% (10·7-19·8) over the same period. Differences in burden due to NCDs, CMNN diseases, and injuries persisted across age, sex, time, and location. Based on our risk analysis, nearly 50% (1·27 billion [1·18-1·38]) of the roughly 2·80 billion total global DALYs in 2023 were attributable to the 88 risk factors analysed in GBD. Globally, the five level 3 risk factors contributing the highest proportion of risk-attributable DALYs were high systolic blood pressure (SBP), particulate matter pollution, high fasting plasma glucose (FPG), smoking, and low birthweight and short gestation-with high SBP accounting for 8·4% (6·9-10·0) of total DALYs. Of the three overarching level 1 GBD risk factor categories-behavioural, metabolic, and environmental and occupational-risk-attributable DALYs rose between 2010 and 2023 only for metabolic risks, increasing by 30·7% (24·8-37·3); however, age-standardised DALY rates attributable to metabolic risks decreased by 6·7% (2·0-11·0) over the same period. For all but three of the 25 leading level 3 risk factors, age-standardised rates dropped between 2010 and 2023-eg, declining by 54·4% (38·7-65·3) for unsafe sanitation, 50·5% (33·3-63·1) for unsafe water source, and 45·2% (25·6-72·0) for no access to handwashing facility, and by 44·9% (37·3-53·5) for child growth failure. The three leading level 3 risk factors for which age-standardised attributable DALY rates rose were high BMI (10·5% [0·1 to 20·9]), drug use (8·4% [2·6 to 15·3]), and high FPG (6·2% [-2·7 to 15·6]; non-significant). INTERPRETATION: Our findings underscore the complex and dynamic nature of global health challenges. Since 2010, there have been large decreases in burden due to CMNN diseases and many environmental and behavioural risk factors, juxtaposed with sizeable increases in DALYs attributable to metabolic risk factors and NCDs in growing and ageing populations. This long-observed consequence of the global epidemiological transition was only temporarily interrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The substantially decreasing CMNN disease burden, despite the 2008 global financial crisis and pandemic-related disruptions, is one of the greatest collective public health successes known. However, these achievements are at risk of being reversed due to major cuts to development assistance for health globally, the effects of which will hit low-income countries with high burden the hardest. Without sustained investment in evidence-based interventions and policies, progress could stall or reverse, leading to widespread human costs and geopolitical instability. Moreover, the rising NCD burden necessitates intensified efforts to mitigate exposure to leading risk factors-eg, air pollution, smoking, and metabolic risks, such as high SBP, BMI, and FPG-including policies that promote food security, healthier diets, physical activity, and equitable and expanded access to potential treatments, such as GLP-1 receptor agonists. Decisive, coordinated action is needed to address long-standing yet growing health challenges, including depressive and anxiety disorders. Yet this can be only part of the solution. Our response to the NCD syndemic-the complex interaction of multiple health risks, social determinants, and systemic challenges-will define the future landscape of global health. To ensure human wellbeing, economic stability, and social equity, global action to sustain and advance health gains must prioritise reducing disparities by addressing socioeconomic and demographic determinants, ensuring equitable health-care access, tackling malnutrition, strengthening health systems, and improving vaccination coverage. We live in times of great opportunity. FUNDING: Gates Foundation and Bloomberg Philanthropies.

Effects of graphene far-infrared and social network interventions on depression, anxiety and dementia in older adults.	BACKGROUND: Five-guaranteed elderly individuals are a special group of the elderly Chinese population faced with unique challenges; these individuals lack any financial resources (including support by relatives), and are solely reliant on the government to provide food, clothing, medical care, and housing as well as burials. In this article, we aim to investigate mood problems (depression, anxiety) and cognitive functioning in Five-guaranteed elderly individuals, and to validate the effectiveness of two promising interventions, graphene far-infrared intervention (GFII; an exploratory and noninvasive technique) and social network intervention (SNI), for elderly people to lay the foundation for future social service work. METHODS: To address the emotional and cognitive difficulties experienced by this special group, we designed this study, which is the first to apply GFII in this population. We also administered SNI given the social isolation of these individuals, in addition to a corresponding control group. 108 elderly individuals in 3 elder care facilities were screened to evaluate eligibility to participate in the current study, including 44 from Facility A (allocated to the GFII group), 43 from Facility B (allocated to the SNI group), and 21 from Facility C (allocated to the control group). GFII lasts for four weeks, with professionally trained carers putting on and removing intervention caps for half an hour each day. SNI lasts for three weeks, three times a week, and consists of a total of nine themed activities. The length of an activity is 90 min. We also did pre- and post-test comparisons of depression, anxiety and cognition in each group of older adults. RESULTS: The results showed that GFII led to immediate improvements in anxiety and cognitive impairment in the five-guaranteed elderly individuals, and the improvement in cognitive function was sustained over time. Moreover, SNI group showed significant improvements in cognitive function after the intervention period. CONCLUSIONS: The GFII is a promising intervention that can be applied to intervene in cognitive and mood disorders in older adults. The GFII has short-term interventions for anxiety in older adults, but long-term effects for cognitive impairment. SNI also had an interventional effect on cognition.

Altered resting-state functional connectivity and dynamic network properties in cognitive impairment: an independent component and dominant-coactivation pattern analyses study.	INTRODUCTION: Cognitive impairment (CI) due to Alzheimer's disease (AD) encompasses a decline in cognitive abilities and can significantly impact an individual's quality of life. Early detection and intervention are crucial in managing CI, both in the preclinical and prodromal stages of AD prior to dementia. METHODS: In this preliminary study, we investigated differences in resting-state functional connectivity and dynamic network properties between 23 individual with CI due to AD based on clinical assessment and 15 healthy controls (HC) using Independent Component Analysis (ICA) and Dominant-Coactivation Pattern (d-CAP) analysis. The cognitive status of the two groups was also compared, and correlations between cognitive scores and d-CAP switching probability were examined. RESULTS: Results showed comparable numbers of d-CAPs in the Default Mode Network (DMN), Executive Control Network (ECN), and Frontoparietal Network (FPN) between HC and CI groups. However, the Visual Network (VN) exhibited fewer d-CAPs in the CI group, suggesting altered dynamic properties of this network for the CI group. Additionally, ICA revealed significant connectivity differences for all networks. Spatial maps and effect size analyses indicated increased coactivation and more synchronized activity within the DMN in HC compared to CI. Furthermore, reduced switching probabilities were observed for the CI group in DMN, VN, and FPN networks, indicating less dynamic and flexible functional interactions. DISCUSSION: The findings highlight altered connectivity patterns within the DMN, VN, ECN, and FPN, suggesting the involvement of multiple functional networks in CI. Understanding these brain processes may contribute to developing targeted diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for CI due to AD.	cognitive impairment; dementia; dominant-coactivation pattern analysis; independent component analysis; resting-state functional connectivity

The association between adult child education and cognitive functioning among older parents: A cross-national comparison of diverse contexts.	INTRODUCTION: The association between adult child educational attainment and older parent's cognitive health may vary across diverse contexts but cross-national comparisons have been limited by differences in outcome assessment, study design, and analytic choices. METHODS: We used harmonized data with comprehensive cognitive assessments from the United States (N = 3088), India (N = 3828), and Mexico (N = 1875) to estimate associations between adult child education and older adults' cognitive functioning using linear regression models adjusted for respondent and family-level socio-economic status (SES) in each study. RESULTS: Each additional year of offspring education was associated with 0.02 (Longitudinal Aging Study in India - Diagnostic Assessment of Dementia [LASI-DAD]) to 0.04 (Health and Retirement Study Harmonized Cognitive Assessment Protocol Survey [HRS-HCAP], Mexican Health and Aging Study Cognitive Aging Ancillary Study [Mex-Cog]) standard deviation (SD) units higher cognitive score (pooled estimate: 0.032 [95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.018-0.046]), comparable to about 1/3-1/4 of the association with respondents' own years of education. Differences by respondent gender were heterogeneous across contexts. DISCUSSION: Consistent overall estimates despite differences in context and potential confounding structures underscore the importance of offspring education for cognitive outcomes among older adults. HIGHLIGHTS: The harmonized study design allows for fair comparisons across diverse contexts. Effect sizes were largely consistent across the United States, India, and Mexico, despite differences in confounding structures. The pooled association between adult child education and parental cognitive functioning was about 1/3-1/4 of the association with respondent's own years of education. Heterogeneity in gender differences point to the potential effects of local culture and context.	cognition; cross‐national; dementia; education; intergenerational transmission

Early axonal degeneration linked to clinical decline in Alzheimer's disease progression revealed with diffusion MRI.	BACKGROUND: Axonal degeneration is believed to be an early hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study investigated the temporal trajectory of axonal loss and its association with cognitive and functional decline using diffusion MRI-derived Axonal Density Index (dMRI-ADI). METHODS: Longitudinal dMRI, CSF and PET data from the ADNI were analyzed, including 117 cognitively normal (CN) and 88 impaired (CI) subjects, consisting of 74 mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 14 AD individuals. Linear mixed-effects models examined group differences as well as associations between baseline and longitudinal changes in ADI, CSF or PET biomarkers and clinical outcomes. Results derived from larger CSF (n=527) and PET (tau-PET: n=870; amyloid-PET: n=1581) data were also presented. RESULTS: Compared to CN, the CI group exhibited significantly lower baseline ADI values and steeper longitudinal decline (p<10-⁶). Lower baseline ADI predicted faster cognitive and functional decline in the CI group (MMSE: p=0.03; CDR-SB: p<10-⁴), and longitudinal decreases in ADI were associated with worsening clinical outcomes (MMSE: p=0.001; CDR-SB: p<10-¹²). Compared to CSF and PET biomarkers, ADI demonstrated superior sensitivity in tracking disease progression and matched these biomarkers in predicting future cognitive and functional decline. Furthermore, decreases in ADI were significantly associated with declines in clinical outcomes; an association observed only with amyloid-PET, but not CSF biomarkers. CONCLUSION: Axonal degeneration is an early and clinically meaningful feature of AD. ADI is a promising noninvasive biomarker for early detection, prognosis, and disease monitoring.

Neuropathologic correlates of cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's disease with discordant CSF biomarker profiles: co-pathologies in focus.	CSF Aβ reflects Alzheimer's disease neuropathologic change (ADNC), while CSF p-tau offers an indirect indication of tangle pathology. However, interpretation can be challenging when cognitive impairment is present alongside Aβ positivity (Α +) but p-tau negativity (T -). We examined neuropathologic differences between CSF A + T - and A + T + profiles, defined by CSF Aβ42 and p-tau181 levels, hypothesizing that cognitively impaired older adults with a CSF A + T - profile would exhibit a greater co-pathology burden, suggesting alternative contributing disease processes. We identified 77 ADNI participants with available CSF biomarkers and neuropathologic assessments (median age = 79.8 years; IQR = 74.7-84.5). Depending on the presence-alone or in combination-of ADNC intermediate/high and non-ADNC pathologies (e.g., Lewy bodies (LB), argyrophilic grain disease (AGD), limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy-neuropathologic change (LATE-NC)), individuals were classified as ADNC dominant, mixed ADNC, or non-ADNC dominant. The two CSF A + profiles were similar in demographics, frequency of cognitive impairment, longitudinal cognitive performance, clinical comorbidities, CSF Aβ42 levels, CSF α-synuclein positivity rates, and Aβ PET burden. ADNC intermediate/high was significantly more frequent in the CSF A + T + profile than in the CSF A + T - profile (100% vs. 78%, p value = 0.008). The most common co-pathologies contributing to cognitive impairment in the CSF A + T - profile were LATE-NC (stages 2-3) (47%), LB limbic/neocortical (44%), and AGD (stages II-III) (33%), while in the CSF A + T + profile, LB limbic/neocortical (28%) and LATE-NC (stages 2-3) (22%) predominated. The CSF A + T - profile showed 17% ADNC dominant, 61% mixed ADNC, and 22% non-ADNC dominant pathology, whereas the CSF A + T + profile showed 51% ADNC dominant and 49% mixed ADNC pathology (p = 0.001). Within the mixed ADNC subgroup, individuals with a CSF A + T - profile more often exhibited two or more non-ADNC co-pathologies compared to those with a CSF A + T + profile (73% vs. 21%, p = 0.009). Despite clinical similarities among cognitively impaired individuals with CSF A + T - and A + T + profiles, the CSF A + T - profile may reflect a greater burden of non-ADNC pathology. Extending biomarker profiling beyond Aβ and tau may facilitate more personalized care.	ADNC; AT biomarker system; Alzheimer; CSF; Co-pathologies; p-tau; β-amyloid

Cerebrovascular disease frequently co-occurs with amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and tau tangles, the pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD), compounding cognitive decline. Aβ deposition is also central to cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), yet peripheral biomarkers that specifically reflect CAA-related vascular pathology remain elusive. Here, we integrated proteomic, imaging, clinical, neuropathological, and genomic data from brain and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to define molecular signatures distinguishing CAA from plaque pathology. Proteomic profiling of 118 cerebrovascular-enriched brain samples quantified over 11,000 proteins, revealing co-expression modules enriched for extracellular matrix (ECM) components strongly linked to CAA. In CSF proteomes from 1,104 individuals, vascular ECM module proteins (e.g., CRIP1, LTBP1, PRSS23) were associated with CAA, white matter hyperintensities (WMH), microbleeds, and infarcts but not Aβ plaque burden. Integrating AD genome-wide association studies and CSF protein quantitative trait loci (pQTLs) identified CRIP1 as a candidate causal protein for AD. Carriers of the minor allele at the CRIP1 pQTL exhibited reduced CRIP1 levels, less WMH, and lower CSF levels of ECM proteins linked to CAA. In vitro, CRIP1 bound Aβ and accelerated fibril formation, providing a mechanistic link to vascular amyloid pathology. These findings establish overlapping brain and CSF biomarkers for CAA and identify CRIP1 and vascular ECM pathways as candidate targets for precision diagnostics and therapeutic intervention.

An unsupervised XAI framework for dementia detection with context enrichment.	Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods enhance the diagnostic efficiency of clinical decision support systems by making the predictions of a convolutional neural network's (CNN) on brain imaging more transparent and trustworthy. However, their clinical adoption is limited due to limited validation of the explanation quality. Our study introduces a framework that evaluates XAI methods by integrating neuroanatomical morphological features with CNN-generated relevance maps for disease classification. We trained a CNN using brain MRI scans from six cohorts: ADNI, AIBL, DELCODE, DESCRIBE, EDSD, and NIFD (N = 3253), including participants that were cognitively normal, with amnestic mild cognitive impairment, dementia due to Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal dementia. Clustering analysis benchmarked different explanation space configurations by using morphological features as proxy-ground truth. We implemented three post-hoc explanations methods: (i) by simplifying model decisions, (ii) explanation-by-example, and (iii) textual explanations. A qualitative evaluation by clinicians (N = 6) was performed to assess their clinical validity. Clustering performance improved in morphology enriched explanation spaces, improving both homogeneity and completeness of the clusters. Post hoc explanations by model simplification largely delineated converters and stable participants, while explanation-by-example presented possible cognition trajectories. Textual explanations gave rule-based summarization of pathological findings. Clinicians' qualitative evaluation highlighted challenges and opportunities of XAI for different clinical applications. Our study refines XAI explanation spaces and applies various approaches for generating explanations.

Brain aging and cognitive decline accelerate beyond a threshold of periventricular white matter hyperintensity.	A substantial subset of cognitively normal (CN) older adults accumulates high burdens of Periventricular (PVWMH) and Deep White Matter Hyperintensities (DWMH), surrogate neuroimaging-markers of cerebral small-vessel disease, while others have minimal or no white matter hyperintensity (WMH). Using multi-modal Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) from National Alzheimer's Coordinating Centre (NACC) (n = 986) and Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) (n = 382) cohorts spanning CN, cognitively impaired (CI), and CI with Alzheimer's etiology (CI-AD) aged 50-94 years, we investigated whether total WMH burden or specifically PVWMH and DWMH, surpassing a threshold disrupts neuroanatomy and cognition. PVWMH and DWMH volume increased exponentially with age, but PVWMH rose twice as fast, with inflection at 61 years. PVWMH > 2.3 mL, independent of age, was associated with structural atrophy (rostralmiddlefrontal, pre/postcentral gyri, lingual-gyrus, nucleus-accumbens), global fiber disintegration, and impairments in executive, attentional, semantic domains. DWMH effects were negligible. Longitudinal mixed-models in NACC and ADNI confirmed that PVWMH progression, not DWMH, predicted accelerated atrophy. PVWMH-related neuroanatomic loss mediates cognitive decline. The 2.3 mL threshold was validated in ADNI3. While both are visible on routine MRI, only PVWMH demonstrated threshold-dependent effects. Progression to ≥2.3 mL marks a threshold, demanding clinical surveillance, vascular-risk management, and recognition of accelerated brain-aging. Neuroimaging-based quantification of PVWMH, combined with domain-specific cognitive testing provides robust measures of clinical surveillance, definitive of brain health.	aging; axonal fiber damage; cerebral small vessel disease; cognitive impairment; white matter hyperintensity

A multivariate approach to identify association between peripheral blood DNA methylation and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers of Alzheimer disease.	DNA methylation has been shown to play a crucial role in many diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although many studies have correlated DNA methylation in blood samples with risk of clinical AD diagnosis, few have examined links with AD neuropathology. Using data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study, we investigate the associations between peripheral blood DNA methylation and three AD-associated biomarkers in cerebrospinal fluid: amyloid-β, phosphorylated tau-181, and total tau using an innovative multivariate approach. In our approach, we first adjusted the methylation values for covariates that have known wide-spread effects on methylation. We then developed and implemented a multivariate penalized model to find associations, jointly, between CSF biomarkers and sets of methylation residuals defined by regions around each gene. These penalized models then selected probes showing associations with one or more CSF biomarkers. We demonstrate, using both simulations and actual data, that our proposed multivariate approach is beneficial for detecting weak signals. We also provide complementary validation using data from the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging. Our multivariate strategy has the potential to increase feature selection accuracy among correlated predictors in epigenetic studies.

Cerebellar atrophy in biologically confirmed Alzheimer's disease: Associations with amyloidopathy measured by cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers.	BackgroundRecently, a role of the cerebellum in cognition has emerged leading to the investigation of its involvement in neurocognitive diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). A few studies have shown an atrophy of the cerebellar lobes Crus I and II specifically in clinically defined AD patients. So far, no study has been performed to explore the link between biologically defined AD and cerebellar atrophy.ObjectiveTo explore in a large cohort, if biological AD profile was associated with cerebellar atrophy and to explore the determinants of this possible association.MethodsWe used data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI2) database, a large prospective and multicentric study. We collected behavioral, structural magnetic resonance imaging and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers data. Groups were clinically and biologically defined using ATN classification. We compared cerebellar volumes based on ATN status.Results585 participants were analyzed: 295 with biologically defined AD (A + T + or A + T- CSF- profile) and 290 non-AD (A-T- or A-T + CSF profile). Biological AD participants had a significant loss of volume in the Crus II cerebellar lobes compared with non-AD participants (F(1581) = 4.7, p = 0.03), independently from clinical status. In addition, Crus II morphological changes were linked to A + status (F(1564) = 10.6, p = 0.001) and not to T + status, with the existence of a significant correlation between Aβ	Alzheimer's disease; amyloidopathy; cerebellum; magnetic resonance imaging

Comparing the predictive value of plasma p-tau217 and CSF biomarkers (p-tau181, Aβ42) using amyloid positron emission tomography in Alzheimer's continuum.	INTRODUCTION: This study explores the diagnostic accuracy of different biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease (AD) using data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). METHODS: A cross-sectional analysis was performed on individuals with mild cognitive impairment. Key biomarkers assessed included plasma p-tau217, CSF p-tau181, CSF Aβ42, and amyloid PET imaging, alongside clinical assessments using the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) and the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS). RESULTS: Plasma p-tau217 showed the strongest correlation with amyloid-β deposition and clinical scores (Adjusted R DISCUSSION: These results suggest that plasma p-tau217 may serve as a more accurate, cost-effective, and non-invasive alternative to CSF biomarkers and PET imaging. Its superior predictive power highlights its potential in routine clinical settings for early diagnosis and monitoring of AD progression, addressing key challenges in accessibility and patient compliance associated with current diagnostic methods.

Data-driven subtypes of subjective cognitive decline: neuropsychological profiles, Alzheimer's disease biomarkers, and clinical trajectories.	OBJECTIVES: Subjective Cognitive Decline (SCD) is a heterogeneous condition recognized as the earliest manifestation of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We hypothesized that the heterogeneity of SCD may be synthesized in distinct subtypes. METHODS: We analyzed data from the AD Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. For all participants, demographic variables, cognitive measures, APOE genotype, CSF biomarkers, brain MRI, and FDG-PET data were available. Participants underwent follow-up visits every 6 or 12 months. RESULTS: 542 cognitively normal (CN), 346 SCD, and 423 early mild cognitive impairment (E-MCI) individuals were included. A data-driven approach based on cognitive measures identified three SCD clusters (k1, k2, k3) that performed differently in verbal memory (k2 outperformed all the groups and k3 showed the poorest performance, p < 0.001) and in executive function (k1 had the lowest scores, p = 0.006). Regarding CSF biomarkers, k2 exhibited lower p-tau (20.6 ± 9.2 vs. 24.2 ± 13.6, p = 0.03) and k3 had higher Aβ INTERPRETATION: We proposed a three-subgroup system classification for SCD, reflecting different cognitive profiles and longitudinal trajectories. Classifying individuals with SCD may enhance diagnostic pathways and inform personalized interventions.	Alzheimer’s disease; Mild cognitive impairment; Neuropsychology; Subjective cognitive decline

Normative Modelling of Brain Volume for Diagnostic and Prognostic Stratification in Multiple Sclerosis.	BACKGROUND: Brain atrophy is a hallmark of multiple sclerosis (MS). For clinical translatability and individual-level predictions, brain atrophy needs to be put into context of the broader population, using reference or normative models. METHODS: Reference models of MRI-derived brain volumes were established from a large healthy control (HC) multi-cohort dataset (N=63 115, 51% females). The reference models were applied to N=362 people with MS with T FINDINGS: We identified a temporally stable, brain morphometric phenotype of MS. The right and left thalamic volumes most consistently showed significantly lower-than-reference volumes in MS (25% and 26% overlap across the sample). The number of such extreme smaller-than-reference values was 2.70 in MS compared to HC (4.51 versus 1.67). Each extreme norm-deviation indicated stronger disability (Expanded Disability Status Scale: β=0.22, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.32), lower Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test score (β=-0.27, 95% CI -0.52 to -0.02), and higher Fatigue Severity Score (β=0.29, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.53) at baseline, and over time with EDSS (β=0.07, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.13). We additionally provide detailed maps of reference-deviations and their associations with clinical assessments. INTERPRETATION: We present a heterogeneous brain phenotype of MS which is associated with clinical manifestations, and particularly implicating the thalamus. The findings offer potential to aid diagnosis and prognosis of MS.

BACKGROUND: The interthalamic adhesion (IA) is an anatomical bridge connecting the left and right thalamus. While prior studies have explored its prevalence and function in healthy populations, stroke, hydrocephalus, and schizophrenia, none have examined the IA in the context of Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study aims to analyse the prevalence of the IA in the prodromal to clinical AD continuum and evaluate the association with AD cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers and thalamic, hippocampal, and ventricular volumes. METHOD: IA prevalence was assessed in 542 MRIs from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), including healthy controls (HC), early mild cognitive impairment (EMCI), late MCI (LMCI), and AD patients. Inter-rater reliability was assessed with Cohen's Kappa, and a chi-squared test (χ2) examined rater differences. Binary and multinomial logistic regressions evaluated the effect of CSF biomarkers, volumes, and clinical data on IA prevalence and type. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in IA prevalence or variants across the four groups. The single IA was the most common type, while bilobar and double variants were less frequent. Post-hoc analysis, however, showed that AD CSF biomarker measures showed positive associations with the broad IA subtype in HC and EMCI. CONCLUSION: The study found no overall differences in IA prevalence or its variants related to prodromal or clinical AD. Still, elevated Aβ42, p-Tau levels, and larger thalamic volume were linked to a higher likelihood of a broad IA. These findings suggest that the IA may be involved in prodromal AD pathophysiological processes.	Alzheimer’s disease; Interthalamic adhesion; Massa intermedia; Thalamus

The presymptomatic and early manifestations of semantic dementia.	People with semantic dementia (SD) or semantic variant primary progressive aphasia typically present with marked atrophy of the anterior temporal lobe, and thereafter progress more slowly than other forms of frontotemporal dementia. This suggests a prolonged prodromal phase with accumulation of neuropathology and minimal symptoms, about which little is known. To study early and presymptomatic SD, we first examine a well-characterised cohort of people with SD recruited from the Cambridge Centre for Frontotemporal Dementia. Five people with early SD had coincidental MRI prior to the onset of symptoms, or were healthy volunteers in research with anterior temporal lobe atrophy as an incidental finding. We model longitudinal imaging changes in left- and right-lateralised SD to predict atrophy at symptom onset. We then assess 61,203 participants with structural brain MRI in the UK Biobank to find individuals with imaging changes in keeping with SD but with no neurodegenerative diagnosis. To identify these individuals in UK Biobank, we design an ensemble-based classifier, differentiating baseline structural MRI in SD from healthy controls and patients with other neurodegenerative diseases, including other causes of frontotemporal lobar degeneration. We train the classifier on a Cambridge-based cohort (SD n=47, other neurodegenerative diseases n=498, healthy controls n=88) and test it on a combined cohort from the Neuroimaging in Frontotemporal Dementia study and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (SD n=42, other neurodegenerative n=449, healthy control n=127). From our case series, we find people with marked atrophy three to five years before recognition of symptom onset in left- or right-predominant SD. We present right-lateralised cases with subtle multimodal semantic impairment, found concurrently with only mild behavioural disturbance. We show that imaging measures can be used to reliably and accurately differentiate clinical SD from other neurodegenerative diseases (recall 0.88, precision 0.95, F1 score 0.91). We find individuals with no neurodegenerative diagnosis in the UK Biobank with striking left-lateralised (prevalence ages 45-85 4.8/100,000) or right-lateralised (5.9/100,000) anterior temporal lobe atrophy, with deficits on cognitive testing suggestive of semantic impairment. These individuals show progressive involvement of other cognitive domains in longitudinal follow-up. Together, our findings suggest that (i) there is a burden of incipient early anterior temporal lobe atrophy in older populations, with comparable prevalence of left- and right-sided cases from this prospective unbiased approach to identification, (ii) substantial atrophy is required for manifest symptoms, particularly in right-lateralised cases, and (iii) semantic deficits across multiple domains can be detected in the early symptomatic phase.	machine learning classification; semantic behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia; semantic dementia; semantic variant primary progressive aphasia

Machine learning diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment using advanced diffusion MRI and CSF biomarkers.	INTRODUCTION: Machine learning applied to neuroimaging can help with medical diagnosis and early detection by identifying biomarkers of subtle changes in brain structure and function. The effectiveness of advanced diffusion MRI (dMRI) methods for pre-dementia classification remains largely unexplored, particularly when combined with CSF biomarkers. METHODS: We implemented XGBoost machine learning models to evaluate the classification potential of dMRI parameters (derived using NODDI, C-NODDI, MAP, or SMI), CSF biomarkers of Alzheimer's pathology (Tau, pTau, Aβ42, Aβ40), and pairwise dMRI + CSF combinations in distinguishing cognitive normality from mild cognitive impairment. RESULTS: MAP-RTAP (AUC = 0.78) and pTau/Aβ42 (AUC = 0.76) were the best performing individual biomarkers. Combining C-NDI derived using C-NODDI and Aβ42/Aβ40 achieved the highest performance (AUC = 0.84) and accuracy (0.84), while other combinations optimized either sensitivity (0.93) or specificity (0.88). DISCUSSION: dMRI biomarkers demonstrate comparable performance to CSF biomarkers, with notable improvements achieved when combined. This study highlights dMRI's effectiveness for enhancing early AD detection. HIGHLIGHTS: Advanced multishell diffusion MRI provides equivalent performance as CSF biomarkers in classifying MCICombining diffusion MRI and CSF biomarkers improves classification performanceStatistical diffusion MRI models perform best when used individually to classify MCIThe pTau/Aβ42 ratio outperforms other individual CSF biomarkers in MCI diagnosisBiophysical diffusion MRI models achieve the best performance when combined with CSF data.	alzheimer's disease; csf biomarkers; diffusion mri; early diagnostics; machine learning; mild cognitive impairment; neuroimaging

A comprehensive Investigation of the associations between cerebral blood flow and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers across the Alzheimer's disease continuum.	BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by a complex interplay between amyloid-β (Aβ) and tau pathologies, with increasing evidence implicating cerebral blood flow (CBF) alterations as a critical, yet underexplored, contributor to disease progression. This study aimed to investigate the associations between regional CBF and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers- Aβ1-42, total tau (T-Tau), and phosphorylated tau (P-Tau181)-across the AD continuum. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis using data from 416 participants enrolled in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), including cognitively normal individuals, patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and those with AD. CSF biomarker concentrations were measured using the INNO-BIA AlzBio3 immunoassay on the Luminex xMAP platform. Regional CBF was quantified using arterial spin labeling (ASL) MRI. Associations between CSF biomarkers and CBF were assessed using partial correlation and general linear models, adjusting for age and gender. Multiple comparisons were corrected using the false discovery rate (FDR) approach. RESULTS: In CN participants, CBF in the right inferior temporal cortex showed a positive association with Aβ1-42 levels (r = 0.348, p = 0.04). In the MCI group, elevated T-Tau and P-Tau181 levels were inversely associated with CBF in the left temporal pole (T-Tau: r = -0.296, p = 0.016; P-Tau₁₈₁: r = -0.311, p = 0.011). In participants with AD, widespread and robust positive correlations emerged between tau biomarkers and CBF, particularly in the posterior cingulate cortex, corpus callosum, and multiple frontal and parietal regions (e.g., P-Tau181 and posterior cingulate: β = 0.850, p = 0.004). CONCLUSION: Our findings reveal stage-dependent and region-specific associations between cerebral perfusion and CSF biomarkers. In early stages, tau pathology is linked to hypoperfusion, whereas in established AD, elevated tau levels are paradoxically associated with increased CBF-potentially reflecting compensatory or neuroinflammatory mechanisms. These results underscore the complex neurovascular dynamics in AD and support the vascular hypothesis, suggesting that targeting CBF alterations may offer a viable therapeutic avenue, particularly in preclinical and prodromal stages.

Integrative effects of Telomere Length, Epigenetic Age, and Mitochondrial DNA abundance in Alzheimer's Disease.	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Biological age, reflecting the cumulative molecular and cellular damage such as telomere attrition, epigenetic alterations and mitochondrial dysfunction, may better capture age-related decline and Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk than chronological age. Most studies have focused on one measure of biological age and not investigated joint or interactive contributions to AD pathogenesis. METHODS: We estimated blood-derived telomere length (TL) via qPCR, epigenetic age (DNAm age) using the CausAge clock, and mitochondrial DNA copy number (mtDNAcn) from whole genome sequencing in 640 participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI; Age: 74.91±7.56, Female: 44.8%, Cognitively Unimpaired: 34.3%, Mild Cognitive Impairment: 52%, AD: 12.9%). Linear mixed-effects models examined the associations and interactions of these markers with cognitive decline for memory, executive function, language ability, visuospatial ability, and global cognition, while linear regression tested associations with cross-sectional AD biomarkers (CSF Aβ RESULTS: Individually, TL and DNAm age, were not associated with cognition, CSF biomarkers, or neuroimaging outcomes, while higher mtDNAcn was associated with lower CSF tau and ptau DISCUSSION: These findings suggest that increased mtDNAcn may act as a compensatory response to accelerated epigenetic aging and telomere attrition. Our results underscore the importance of evaluating the interplay among multiple biological aging markers when investigating AD pathogenesis.

Associations of Plasma p-tau181 With Age, Adjusted for Kidney Function and Sociodemographic Factors.	INTRODUCTION: Plasma phosphorylated tau (p-tau) levels, such as p-tau181, are elevated in Alzheimer's disease compared to cognitively unimpaired individuals. They represent potential candidate blood biomarkers for use in memory services where CSF examinations are not available. However, the effect of age on plasma p-tau levels remains undetermined. Limited studies have investigated the association between age and plasma p-tau thus far, and fewer still have differentiated levels by brain amyloid pathology. Characterising these associations and determining if this is influenced by sociodemographic factors or medical comorbidities is important for establishing blood biomarker reference ranges. METHODS: Using ADNI data, we analysed 860 observations (581 participants; age range: 55-95 years; 56.0% male; 93.6% White). Linear mixed models (LMMs) estimated fixed effects of age, creatinine, baseline BMI, sex, ethnicity, and group (Control vs. AD) on plasma p-tau181 concentration, with a random intercept for participant ID. Separate LMMs assessed covariate effects and interactions with group status. RESULTS: Analysis of ADNI data revealed a significant positive association between p-tau181 levels, group status, and creatinine in the fully adjusted LLM. Group status may have obscured the total effect of age on p-tau181, as its removal from the model resulted in a significant age effect. Single-variable models showed the positive association between either age, or creatinine and p-tau181 levels did not differ between control and AD groups. There was a significant negative association between BMI and plasma p-tau, which was stronger in AD versus control groups. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides insights into the factors that may influence plasma p-tau181 levels. These findings underscore the need to account for clinical and demographic factors when interpreting p-tau181. Future research should validate these associations in diverse populations and explore underlying mechanisms.	Alzheimer's disease; dementia; diagnosis; plasma biomarkers; p‐tau

Clinical Performance of the Elecsys CSF pTau	INTRODUCTION: Amyloid- and tau-positron emission tomography (PET) are promising modalities for detecting pathological changes associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD); however, their application is limited. Although the use of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers as alternatives to amyloid-PET and tau-PET has been explored, no in vitro diagnostic-approved or commercial CSF biomarker assays are currently available for detecting tau pathology in clinical practice.

Evaluating the Predictive Value of Oxylipins for Cognitive Measures and White Matter Hyperintensities in Alzheimer's Disease Continuum Compared to Conventional Beta‑amyloid and Tau Protein Biomarkers.	Oxylipins are signaling molecules that result from the oxidation of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, and they have been attracting attention due to their potential use as biomarkers for the early detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other disorders. In contrast to beta-amyloid and tau protein biomarkers, we aimed to investigate the potential of oxylipins as an AD biomarker to predict cognitive measures. This study analyzed data from 703 participants (mean age 60 years) from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). We included 150 cognitively normal (CN) participants, 240 patients with early mild cognitive impairment (EMCI), 145 with late mild cognitive impairment (LMCI), 59 with subjetive memory complaints (SMC), and 109 with AD. Cognitive assessments were conducted using the clinical dementia rating scale (CDR), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers (Aβ1-42 and p-tau181) were measured via the Luminex platform. Metabolite associations with CSF biomarkers were evaluated using random forest regression and linear regression models, with adjustments for age and sex and normalization for total intracranial volume (tICV). In the random forest regression model, Aβ42 was the most significant predictor for EMCI, while BSH_Sphingosine1P18.2 and BSL_GCDCA were significant for LMCI and MCI, respectively. Aβ42 appeared in SMC and CN but with lower significance than in EMCI. In CN, ASL_ResolvinE2 was most important. BSL_12_HETE was the strongest predictor for AD (R-squared = 0.199, metabolite-CSF R-squared = 0.024). Additionally, BSH_FA20.4_w6 (R-squared = 0.1772) outperformed CSF metabolites in EMCI detection, and BSH_Sphingosine1P16.1 (R-squared = 0.19) outperformed CSF metabolites in LMCI detection. Our findings suggest that select oxylipins may serve as predictive biomarkers of cognitive performance, although conventional CSF biomarkers remain superior for predicting the cognitive findings in the early stages.

Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) is prevalent in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here, we assessed how self-reported SDB is linked with AD biomarkers, including amyloid-beta plaque burden (Aβ), regional fluorodeoxyglucose uptake (rFDG-PET), grey matter volume (GMV), cognitive scores, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers. We selected 757 individuals, including AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and cognitively unimpaired (CU) groups, and divided them according to self-reported SDB condition. Using a stratified subsampling approach, we selected 512 matched subsamples, and effect sizes (ES) of the group-SDB interaction were computed for each biomarker and cognitive score across subsamples. Linear regression assessed associations between the ES of Aβ, rFDG, and GMV with the ES of cognitive scores and CSF biomarkers. The group-SDB interaction had a medium-sized effect on Aβ, rFDG, and GMV biomarkers in several brain areas. Participants with SDB exhibited reduced Aβ burden and increased rFDG uptake in the CU and MCI groups, whereas the AD group showed elevated Aβ burden and decreased rFDG. Additionally, SDB+ individuals demonstrated GMV alterations across all groups. The ES of group-SDB interaction on Aβ in the precuneus, middle temporal gyrus, and fusiform gyrus was associated with the ES of cognitive scores. Taken together, we observed a robust association of SDB with Aβ pathology in PET and CSF relative to rFDG and GMV in the AD group, which was also associated with cognitive decline.

Decreased DTI-APLS correlated with cognitive impairment in veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder.	Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a risk for cognitive impairment with underlying mechanism unresolved. Our study aimed to evaluate the glymphatic function in veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and to explore associations between glymphatic function, sleep patterns, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers (Aβ, t-tau, p-tau), and cognitive impairment. In our study, we included 43 Vietnam War veterans with PTSD and 43 controls. Diffusion tensor image analysis along the perivascular space (DTI-ALPS) was calculated to reflect glymphatic function. Multiple linear regressions and mediation analyses were employed to examine the relationships between the clinician-administered PTSD scale (CAPS) scores, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), DTI-ALPS and cognitive impairment. Our study revealed that PTSD group exhibited lower DTI-ALPS (p = 0.001), higher CAPS (p < 0.001), higher PSQI (p < 0.001), and poorer cognitive performance in CDR-SoB (p = 0.019) and ADAS-Cog total 13 (p = 0.009). CAPS was significantly associated with DTI-ALPS (β = -0.0018, 95% CI: -0.0029, -0.0006, p = 0.0028). PSQI demonstrated an indirect effect (β = -0.0005, 95% CI: -0.0011, -0.0001) and mediated 21.74% effect for the relationship between CAPS and DTI-ALPS. CAPS was significantly associated with CDR-SoB and ADAS-Cog total 13 (β = 0.0067, 95% CI: 0.00087, 0.0124, p = 0.024; β = 0.058, 95% CI: 0.013, 0.103, p = 0.012). DTI-ALPS had an indirect effect (β = 0.0024, 95% CI: 0.0006, 0.0069) and mediated all effect for the relationship between CAPS and CDR-SoB. In conclusion, glymphatic system was impaired in PTSD veterans revealed by DTI-ALPS, and poor sleep quality partially mediated the relationship between PTSD severity and impaired glymphatic function. DTI-ALPS mediated the relationship between PTSD severity and cognitive impairment.	Cognitive impairment; DTI-ALPS; Glymphatic system; Post-traumatic stress disorder; Sleep

BACKGROUND: Event-based modeling (EBM) traces sequential progression of events in complex processes like neurodegenerative diseases, adept at handling uncertainties. This study validated an EBM for Alzheimer's disease (AD) staging designed by EuroPOND, an EU-funded Horizon 2020 project, using research and real-world datasets, a crucial step towards application in multi-center trials. METHODS: The training dataset comprised 1737 subjects from ADNI-1/GO/2, using the EuroPOND EBM toolbox. Testing datasets included a research cohort from University of Antwerp (controls, CN (n = 46), subjective cognitive decline, SCD (n = 10), mild cognitive impairment, MCI (n = 47), AD dementia, ADD (n = 16)) and a real-world cohort from 9 Belgian Dementia Council memory clinics (CN (n = 91), SCD (n = 66), (non-amnestic) naMCI (n = 54), aMCI (n = 255), and ADD (n = 220). Biomarkers included: 2 clinical scores (Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT)); 3 CSF-biomarkers (Aβ RESULTS: The research cohort's maximum likelihood event sequence comprised CSF Aβ CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the generalizability of EuroPOND's AD EBM model across research and real-world clinical datasets, supporting its use in multi-center trials. aMCI subjects generally reside in more advanced stages than naMCI, who may not necessarily have AD, demonstrating utility for precision recruitment/screening.

Comparative performance of plasma pTau181/Aβ42, pTau217/Aβ42 ratios, and individual measurements in detecting brain amyloidosis.	BACKGROUND: Early detection of brain amyloidosis (Aβ+) is crucial for diagnosing Alzheimer' disease (AD) and optimizing patient management, especially in light of emerging treatments. While plasma biomarkers are promising, their combined diagnostic value through specific ratios remains underexplored. In this study, we assess the diagnostic accuracy of plasma pTau isoform (pTau181 and pTau217) to Aβ42 ratios in detecting Aβ+ status. METHODS: This study included 423 participants from the multicenter prospective ALZAN cohort, recruited for cognitive complaints. Aβ+ status was determined using cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers. The confirmatory cohort comprises 1176 patient samples from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), with Aβ+ status determined by positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. Plasma biomarkers (pTau181, pTau217, Aβ40, Aβ42) were measured using immunoassays and mass spectrometry, with specific ratios calculated. In the ALZAN cohort, the impact of confounding factors such as age, renal function, ApoE 4 status, body mass index, and the delay between blood collection and processing was also evaluated to assess their influence on biomarker concentrations and diagnostic performance. The primary outcome was the diagnostic performance of plasma biomarkers and their ratios for detecting Aβ+ status. Secondary outcomes in the ALZAN cohort included the proportion of patients classified as low, intermediate, or high risk for Aβ+ using a two-cutoff approach. FINDINGS: In ALZAN the pTau181/Aβ42 ratio matched the diagnostic performance of pTau217 (AUC of 0.911 (0.882-0.940) vs. 0.909 (0.879-0.939), P = 0.85). The pTau217/Aβ42 ratio demonstrated the highest diagnostic accuracy, with an AUC of 0.927 (0.900-0.954). Both ratios effectively mitigated confounding factors, such as variations in renal function, and were also efficient in identifying Aβ+ status in individuals with early cognitive decline. Diagnostic accuracy of ratios vs. individual measurement was confirmed in the ADNI cohort. In ALZAN, using two-cutoff workflows with pTau217/Aβ42 instead of pTau217 alone reduced the intermediate-risk zone from ∼16% to ∼8%, enhancing stratification for clinical decision-making. INTERPRETATION: The pTau217/Aβ42 ratio demonstrated improved diagnostic performance for detecting Aβ+ compared to individual biomarkers, potentially reducing diagnostic uncertainty. These findings suggest that plasma biomarker ratios could be useful; however, further validation in independent and diverse clinical settings is necessary before broader clinical implementation.

Brain MRI signatures across sex and CSF Alzheimer's disease biomarkers.	The relationship between cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease and neurodegenerative effects is not fully understood. This study investigates neurodegeneration patterns across CSF Alzheimer's disease biomarker groups, the association of brain volumes with CSF amyloid and tau status and sex differences in these relationships in a clinical neurology sample. MRI and CSF Alzheimer's disease biomarkers data were analysed in 306 patients of the Mass General Brigham healthcare system aged 50+ (mean age = 68.4 ± 8.8 years; 43.1% female), who had lumbar punctures within 1 year of clinical MRI scans. We first analysed neurodegeneration patterns across four biomarker groups: 60 controls (A-T-&CU; amyloid negative, tau negative, cognitively unimpaired), 25 A+T- (amyloid positive, tau negative), 121 A+T+ (amyloid positive, tau positive) and 100 other dementia (A-T-&CI; amyloid negative, tau negative, cognitively impaired). Second, we examined volumetric associations with amyloid (amyloid positive, tau negative versus control) and tau in the presence of amyloid (amyloid positive, tau positive versus amyloid positive, tau negative) across 52 brain areas. Third, we examined sex differences in these relationships. Finally, we validated core analyses across three independent datasets-NACC (National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center), ADNI (Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative) and EPAD (European Prevention of Alzheimer's Dementia)-totalling 3137 participants, and performed meta-analyses to obtain more robust estimates. We observed distinct neurodegeneration patterns across biomarker groups, with disrupted connectivity (brain volume covariance networks) in amyloid positive and other dementia groups, while amyloid and tau negative, cognitively unimpaired controls exhibited the most connected network. Amyloid was associated with subcortical, cerebellar and brainstem atrophy, with consistent association observations in the thalamus and amygdala across all four datasets. Tau in the presence of amyloid demonstrated general brain shrinkage through enlargement of extracerebral CSF, alongside unexpected ventricle shrinkages. Sex-based analyses revealed that A+T+ (amyloid positive, tau positive) had lower sex differences in connectivity patterns compared with other groups. Sex differences were also noted in amyloid-related ventricular volume changes. This study reveals how amyloid and tau affect brain connectivity and volume across sex and CSF biomarker groups, emphasizing global brain changes and sex differences. By leveraging automated pipelines and advanced MRI and biomarker analyses, we extracted meaningful and replicable findings from heterogeneous clinical samples from real-world data. The meta-analyses across four datasets enhance the generalizability of our results.

INTRODUCTION: Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods enhance the diagnostic efficiency of clinical decision support systems by making the predictions of a convolutional neural network's (CNN) on brain imaging more transparent and trustworthy. However, their clinical adoption is limited due to limited validation of the explanation quality. Our study introduces a framework that evaluates XAI methods by integrating neuroanatomical morphological features with CNN-generated relevance maps for disease classification. METHODS: We trained a CNN using brain MRI scans from six cohorts: ADNI, AIBL, DELCODE, DESCRIBE, EDSD, and NIFD (N=3253), including participants that were cognitively normal, with amnestic mild cognitive impairment, dementia due to Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal dementia. Clustering analysis benchmarked different explanation space configurations by using morphological features as proxy-ground truth. We implemented three post-hoc explanations methods: i) by simplifying model decisions, ii) explanation-by-example, and iii) textual explanations. A qualitative evaluation by clinicians (N=6) was performed to assess their clinical validity. RESULTS: Clustering performance improved in morphology enriched explanation spaces, improving both homogeneity and completeness of the clusters. Post hoc explanations by model simplification largely delineated converters and stable participants, while explanation- by-example presented possible cognition trajectories. Textual explanations gave rule-based summarization of pathological findings. Clinicians' qualitative evaluation highlighted challenges and opportunities of XAI for different clinical applications. CONCLUSION: Our study refines XAI explanation spaces and applies various approaches for generating explanations. Within the context of AI-based decision support system in dementia research we found the explanations methods to be promising towards enhancing diagnostic efficiency, backed up by the clinical assessments.

Epigenome-wide association study of cerebrospinal fluid-based biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease in cognitively normal individuals.	INTRODUCTION: Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are reliable predictors of future AD risk. We investigated whether pre-clinical changes in AD CSF biomarkers are reflected in blood DNA methylation (DNAm) levels in cognitively normal participants. METHODS: We profiled blood-based DNAm with the EPIC array in participants without a diagnosis of cognitive impairment in the Emory Healthy Brain Study (EHBS; N = 495), Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (N = 122), and Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (N = 118) cohorts. Their CSF amyloid beta 42, total tau (t-tau), and phosphorylated tau181 levels were quantified using Elecsys immunoassays. We conducted epigenome-wide association studies to assess associations between DNAm and CSF biomarkers of AD. RESULTS: In EHBS, no loci were Bonferroni significant after adjusting for confounding factors. In the meta-analysis of all three cohorts, DNAm in cg22976567 (LMNA) was significantly associated with higher CSF t-tau levels. DISCUSSION: Our study showed little evidence of an association between differential blood-based DNAm and pre-clinical AD CSF biomarkers. HIGHLIGHTS: We conducted one of the largest (n = 735) blood DNA methylation (DNAm) studies of Alzheimer's disease cerebrospinal fluid (AD CSF) biomarkers. This is the first epigenome-wide association study in cognitively normal participants examining AD CSF biomarkers. Limited associations between blood DNAm and AD CSF biomarkers were identified.

Association of Brain and Ventricular Boundary Shift Integral Measurements with CSF Biomarkers: A Case-Control Study.	AIMS: This study seeks to examine the relationship between cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers (Aβ1-42, Phospho-Tau181p, Total-Tau) and brain volumetric changes measured by Brain Shift Integral (BSI) in Alzheimer's disease (AD) spectrum. We explore the potential of BSI as a complementary, non-invasive tool for early diagnosis and progression monitoring of AD. BACKGROUND: AD is a neurodegenerative disorder marked by amyloid plaques and tau tangles, leading to cognitive decline. CSF biomarkers are key indicators of AD pathology, but their integration with imaging metrics like BSI could enhance early diagnosis. BSI quantifies brain volume changes via MRI, offering valuable insights into neurodegeneration across the AD spectrum. OBJECTIVES: The current study explores the use of BSI and CSF biomarkers for the early detection of Alzheimer's disease. METHODS: This study utilized data from the ADNI database, including CSF biomarkers (Aβ1-42, t-tau, p-- tau181) and BSI measurements from baseline and month 24 visits. Spearman correlations were performed to assess associations between biomarkers and brain volumetric changes. Linear regression models were used to examine the predictive value of biomarkers on BSI, controlling for potential confounders. RESULTS: A total of 239 participants were included in the study, comprising 94 cognitively normal (CN) individuals, 104 with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 41 with AD. Significant negative correlations were observed between Aβ1-42 and both BBSI and VBSI in MCI at baseline (p=0.013) and 24 months (p=0.018), as well as between Aβ1-42 and VBSI in CN at baseline (p=0.039) and 24 months (p=0.033). In MCI, p-tau181 was positively correlated with BBSI (p=0.013) and VBSI (p=0.030) at baseline and with BBSI at 24 months (p=0.013). Linear regression analysis confirmed that Aβ1-42 and p-tau181 significantly predicted BSI measures in MCI (R2=0.141-0.173, p<0.05), while Aβ1-42 was a significant predictor of VBSI in CN (R2=0.156-0.166, p<0.01). No significant associations were found in AD. CONCLUSION: The application of the BSI is pivotal for monitoring brain volume alterations and their association with CSF biomarkers.

A FUNCTIONAL PERSPECTIVE ON THE CONDITIONAL COVARIANCE COMPARISON PROBLEM IN DEMENTIA ANALYSIS.	Although there are many methods available in the literature to compare the covariance structures of two populations, few are suitable for clinical application due to the inability to account for covariate(s) that affect the dependence structure of the variables being investigated. A common method is to adjust the effect of the covariates via a linear model and work with the resulting residuals. However, removing the effects of the covariates could potentially eliminate valuable information from the analysis. We propose a functional nonparametric covariance matrix estimator to account for any given value in the covariate(s), which allows a comparison of the functional covariance structures of the multivariate data. This comparison is facilitated via a test statistic involving the first eigenvalue of the combined form of covariance matrices of the two groups. Three different approaches, namely, the parametric Tracy-Widom, the semi-parametric Forkman's test, and the nonparametric Permutation method, are used to compute the approximate p-values of the test statistic. We have conducted extensive simulation studies to determine the type I error and power of the proposed hypothesis testing methods and developed practical recommendations for implementing this novel approach. Finally, we apply our methods to the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study to compare cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers between dementia and non-dementia cohorts, which offers a fascinating insight into the differences between covariance structures of biomarkers amyloid	CSF biomarkers; Tracy-Widom; conditional covariance function; covariance group comparison; dementia; nonparametric estimation

Postmortem neuropathologies are associated with retrospective tensor-based morphometry findings in Alzheimer's dementia continuum.	BACKGROUND: Understanding the relationship between postmortem neuropathological findings and in vivo imaging biomarkers is crucial for advancing the early diagnosis and treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study investigates the association between postmortem neuropathologies and retrospective Tensor-Based Morphometry (TBM) findings across the Alzheimer's dementia continuum. METHODS: This study utilized tensor-based morphometry (TBM) to investigate structural brain changes associated with AD neuropathology. Data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) were analyzed, including MRI scans and neuropathological findings from 98 participants. Logistic regression was used to explore the relationship between TBM indices and neuropathological outcomes. The diagnostic performance of TBM was evaluated using accuracy analysis. RESULTS: Significant differences in TBM indices (StatROI and TempROI) were observed between the dementia and non-dementia groups. Logistic regression indicated that higher StatROI and TempROI indices were associated with lower odds of AD pathology, such as amyloid plaques (OR = 0.939 and 0.927), neurofibrillary tangles (OR = 0.961 and 0.931), and neuritic plaques (OR = 0.943 and 0.916). Accuracy analysis demonstrated good discriminatory power of TBM indices in differentiating pathologically confirmed AD from non-AD dementia (sensitivity up to 61.29, specificity up to 93.33%) and cognitively normal individual (sensitivity up to 82.26, specificity up to 75%). CONCLUSION: TBM is a promising tool for predicting the underlying neuropathology of AD and distinguishing between different causes of dementia. Integrating TBM into clinical assessments can enhance the accuracy of AD diagnosis and improve patient management.

Blood biomarkers as surrogate endpoints in Alzheimer's disease research.	BACKGROUND: Blood biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease (AD) can be utilized as surrogate endpoints to accelerate therapeutic development for this condition. METHODS: We assessed the association between short-term changes in blood biomarkers and long-term declines in cognitive and brain structure volume measures using the ADNI database, with a focus on amyloid- RESULTS: A trend association was found between changes in the levels of plasma neurofilament light (NfL) at 12 months and changes in the scores on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) at 24 months in Aβ-positive mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients. For A CONCLUSION: Increased plasma levels of NfL or p-tau181 blood biomarkers were found to be associated with reduced brain volumes and/or declined cognitive outcomes, suggesting that these blood biomarkers may have a predictive role in AD trials.

Functional MRI Analysis of Cortical Regions to Distinguish Lewy Body Dementia From Alzheimer's Disease.	OBJECTIVE: Cortical regions such as parietal area H (PH) and the fundus of the superior temporal sulcus (FST) are involved in higher visual function and may play a role in dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), which is frequently associated with hallucinations. The authors evaluated functional connectivity between these two regions for distinguishing participants with DLB from those with Alzheimer's disease (AD) or mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and from cognitively normal (CN) individuals to identify a functional connectivity MRI signature for DLB. METHODS: Eighteen DLB participants completed cognitive testing and functional MRI scans and were matched to AD or MCI and CN individuals whose data were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database (https://adni.loni.usc.edu). Images were analyzed with data from Human Connectome Project (HCP) comparison individuals by using a machine learning-based subject-specific HCP atlas based on diffusion tractography. RESULTS: Bihemispheric functional connectivity of the PH to left FST regions was reduced in the DLB group compared with the AD and CN groups (mean±SD connectivity score=0.307±0.009 vs. 0.456±0.006 and 0.433±0.006, respectively). No significant differences were detected among the groups in connectivity within basal ganglia structures, and no significant correlations were observed between neuropsychological testing results and functional connectivity between the PH and FST regions. Performances on clock-drawing and number-cancelation tests were significantly and negatively correlated with connectivity between the right caudate nucleus and right substantia nigra for DLB participants but not for AD or CN participants. CONCLUSIONS: The functional connectivity between PH and FST regions is uniquely affected by DLB and may help distinguish this condition from AD.

Independent validation of the PrecivityAD2	OBJECTIVE: The diagnostic performance of the Amyloid Probability Score 2 (APS2) - the algorithmic result of the PrecivityAD2 METHODS: Plasma biomarker ratios Aβ42/40 and p-tau217/np-tau217 (expressed as %p-tau217) were quantified and incorporated into the APS2 algorithm in samples obtained from 192 Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative participants with CI (70% mild cognitive impairment / 30% dementia). APS2 diagnostic performance was determined using amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) as the reference standard. Plasma biomarkers were quantified in a CLIA-certified, CAP-accredited laboratory (C2N Diagnostics, St. Louis, MO) using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. RESULTS: APS2 values were significantly higher in the 56% of CI participants with a positive amyloid PET scan. Concordance with amyloid PET was high (AUC-ROC 0.95 (95%CI): 0.93-0.98); 54% of participants had a positive APS2. The previously validated APS2 cut point yielded an overall accuracy of 91% (95%CI: 86-94%), sensitivity 90% (95%CI: 83-94%) and specificity 92% (95%CI: 84-96%). INTERPRETATION: The PrecivityAD2 blood test's APS2 identified brain amyloid pathology with accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity ≥ 90% in this intended use population. This external validation reaffirms the diagnostic robustness of this blood biomarker test and supports its use as a confirmatory test, consistent with published expert recommendations, for assessment of presence or absence of brain amyloid pathology in symptomatic patients.

The CentiMarker project: Standardizing quantitative Alzheimer's disease fluid biomarkers for biologic interpretation.	INTRODUCTION: Biomarkers play a crucial role in understanding Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis and treatment effects. However, comparing biomarker measures without standardization and appreciating their magnitude relative to the disease can be challenging. METHODS: To address this issue, we propose the CentiMarker approach, similar to Centiloid, which provides a standardized scale between normal (0) and nearly maximum abnormal AD (100) ranges. We applied this scale to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers in dominantly inherited AD and sporadic AD cohorts. RESULTS: CentiMarkers facilitated the interpretation of disease abnormality, demonstrating comparable changes and distributions of AD biomarkers across disease stages. CentiMarkers make the treatment effect more comparable than their original scales across various biomarkers. DISCUSSION: The versatility of CentiMarkers makes it a valuable tool for standardized biomarker comparison in AD research, enabling informed cross-study comparisons and contributing to accelerated therapeutic development. Adoption of the CentiMarker scale could enhance biomarker reporting and advance our understanding of AD. HIGHLIGHTS: Comparing fluid biomarkers without appreciating their magnitude relative to the disease can be challenging. We propose a CentiMarker metric to standardize biomarker measures from normal (0) and nearly maximum abnormal AD (100) ranges. CentiMarkers make the treatment effect more comparable across various biomarkers than when using the original scales.	Alzheimer's disease; CentiMarker; biomarker standardization; fluid biomarker

Neuroimaging-derived biological brain age and its associations with glial reactivity and synaptic dysfunction cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers.	Magnetic resonance Imaging (MRI)-derived brain-age prediction is a promising biomarker of biological brain aging. Accelerated brain aging has been found in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other neurodegenerative diseases. However, no previous studies have investigated the relationship between specific pathophysiological pathways in AD and biological brain aging. Here, we studied whether glial reactivity and synaptic dysfunction are associated with biological brain aging in the earliest stages of the Alzheimer's continuum, and if these mechanisms are differently associated with AD-related cortical atrophy. We further evaluated their effects on cognitive decline. We included 380 cognitively unimpaired individuals from the ALFA+ study, for which we computed their brain-age deltas by subtracting chronological age from their brain age predicted by machine learning algorithms. We studied the cross-sectional linear associations between brain-age delta and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers of synaptic dysfunction (neurogranin, GAP43, synaptotagmin-1, SNAP25, and α-synuclein), glial reactivity (sTREM2, YKL-40, GFAP, and S100b) and inflammation (interleukin-6). We also studied the cross-sectional linear associations between AD signature and these CSF biomarkers, We further evaluated the mechanisms linking baseline brain-age delta and longitudinal cognitive decline by performing mediation analyses. To reproduce our findings on an independent cohort, we included 152 cognitively unimpaired and 310 mild cognitive impaired (MCI) individuals from the ADNI study. We found that higher CSF sTREM2 was associated with a younger brain-age after adjusting for AD pathology, both in ALFA+ cognitively unimpaired and in ADNI MCI individuals. Furthermore, we found that CSF sTREM2 fully mediated the link between older brain-age and cognitive decline in ALFA+. In summary, we showed that the protective microglial state reflected by higher CSF sTREM2 has a beneficial impact on biological brain aging that may partly explains the variability in cognitive decline in early AD stages, independently of AD pathology.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) poses significant global health challenges due to its increasing prevalence and associated societal costs. Early detection and diagnosis of AD are critical for delaying progression and improving patient outcomes. Traditional diagnostic methods and single-modality data often fall short in identifying early-stage AD and distinguishing it from Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). This study addresses these challenges by introducing a novel approach: multImodal enseMble via class BALancing diversity for iMbalancEd Data (IMBALMED). IMBALMED integrates multimodal data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database, including clinical assessments, neuroimaging phenotypes, biospecimen, and subject characteristics data. It employs a new ensemble of model classifiers, designed specifically for this framework, which combines eight distinct families of learning paradigms trained with diverse class balancing techniques to overcome class imbalance and enhance model accuracy. We evaluate IMBALMED on two diagnostic tasks (binary and ternary classification) and four binary early detection tasks (at 12, 24, 36, and 48 months), comparing its performance with state-of-the-art algorithms and an unbalanced dataset method. To further validate the proposed model and ensure genuine generalization to real-world scenarios, we conducted an external validation experiment using data from the most recent phase of the ADNI dataset. IMBALMED demonstrates superior diagnostic accuracy and predictive performance in both binary and ternary classification tasks, significantly improving early detection of MCI at a 48-month time point and showing excellent generalizability in the 12-month task during external validation. The method shows improved classification performance and robustness, offering a promising solution for early detection and management of AD.

Linking genomic and proteomic signatures to brain amyloid burden: insights from GR@ACE/DEGESCO.	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex disease with a strong genetic component, yet many genetic risk factors remain unknown. We combined genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on amyloid endophenotypes measured in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and positron emission tomography (PET) as surrogates of amyloid pathology, which may provide insights into the underlying biology of the disease. We performed a meta-GWAS of CSF Aβ42 and PET measures combining six independent cohorts (n = 2,076). Given the opposite beta direction of Aβ phenotypes in CSF and PET measures, only genetic signals showing opposite directions were considered for analysis (n = 376,599). We explored the amyloidosis signature in the CSF proteome using SOMAscan proteomics (ACE cohort, n = 1,008), connected it with GWAS loci modulating amyloidosis and performed an enrichment analysis of overlapping hits. Finally, we compared our results with a large meta-analysis using publicly available datasets in CSF (n = 13,409) and PET (n = 13,116). After filtering the meta-GWAS, we observed genome-wide significance in the rs429358-APOE locus and annotated nine suggestive hits. We replicated the APOE loci using the large CSF-PET meta-GWAS, identifying multiple AD-associated genes including the novel GADL1 locus. Additionally, we found 1,387 FDR-significant SOMAscan proteins associated with CSF Aβ42 levels. The overlap among GWAS loci and proteins associated with amyloid burden was minimal (n = 35). The enrichment analysis revealed mechanisms connecting amyloidosis with the plasma membrane's anchored component, synapse physiology and mental disorders that were replicated in the large CSF-PET meta-analysis. Combining CSF and PET amyloid GWAS with CSF proteome analyses may effectively elucidate causative molecular mechanisms behind amyloid mobilization and AD physiopathology.

Accurate staging of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology is crucial for therapeutic trials and prognosis, but existing fluid biomarkers lack specificity, especially for assessing tau deposition severity, in amyloid-beta (Aβ)-positive patients. We analyze cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from 136 participants in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative using more than 6,000 proteins. We apply machine learning to predict AD pathological stages defined by amyloid and tau positron emission tomography (PET). We identify two distinct protein panels: 16 proteins, including neurofilament heavy chain (NEFH) and SPARC-related modular calcium-binding protein 1 (SMOC1), that distinguished Aβ-negative/tau-negative (A-T-) from A+ individuals and nine proteins, such as HCLS1-associated protein X-1 (HAX1) and glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (GPI), that differentiated A+T+ from A+T- stages. These signatures outperform the established CSF biomarkers (area under the curve [AUC]: 0.92 versus 0.67-0.70) and accurately predicted disease progression over a decade. The findings are validated in both internal and external cohorts. These results underscore the potential of proteomic-based signatures to refine AD diagnostic criteria and improve patient stratification in clinical trials.

Growth-Associated Protein 43 Levels in the Cerebrospinal Fluid Correspond to the Cerebral Blood Flow Alterations in Alzheimer's Dementia Continuum: An Original Study.	BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a widespread neurodegenerative condition that has a growing impact on a global scale. This study aims to examine the relationship between cerebral blood flow (CBF) and the synaptic biomarker growth-associated protein 43 (GAP-43) through the utilization of arterial spin labeling (ASL). The research identified noteworthy correlations between cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) GAP-43 levels, CBF, and cognitive composite scores, especially among participants with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) who possess the APOE-ε4 gene. METHODS: The study examined 92 participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database, including 36 cognitively normal (CN) and 56 MCI. The cognitive status of 42 participants was evaluated using ADNI composite scores. Independent t-tests and Mann-Whitney tests were used for the comparison of continuous variables between groups, and multiple linear regression analysis with adjustments for confounding factors was used to assess the relationship between GAP-43 and CBF values. RESULTS: Significant positive correlations were observed between GAP-43 levels and (A) the executive function composite score (ADNI_EF) in CN individuals, as well as (B) the language composite score (ADNI_LAN) in individuals with MCI. CSF biomarkers and ASL regions did not show statistical significance between diagnostic groups after correction for multiple comparisons. No significant differences in baseline characteristics were found between diagnostic groups. However, associations were observed between ROI CBF and Mini Mental State Examination in various subgroups. CONCLUSION: The findings indicate a potential function for ASL perfusion in identifying early AD-related alterations and gaining insight into the pathophysiology of AD and mild cognitive impairment.The study revealed associations between CBF, cognitive scores, and APOE-ε4 gene status. This study contributes to the comprehension of the correlation between CSF biomarkers, regional brain perfusion, and cognitive function in individuals with AD using ASL as a noninvasive approach.	alzheimer's disease; arterial spin labeling; biomarker; growth‐associated protein 43

Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) can be used to detect early signs of increased water diffusivity in white matter tracts in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). This study examined how DTI, alongside cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers (like tau proteins and amyloid-β), can help identify early brain changes in MCI. We included 159 individuals (92 with MCI and 67 healthy controls) from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and extracted their demographics, CSF biomarkers, and DTI metrics. We compared the biomarkers (CSF biomarkers and DTI markers in 57 white matter tracts) between the two study groups using a general linear model, adjusting for age, sex, and handedness. CSF biomarker levels showed a statistically significant difference between the two study groups. Also, diffusion properties of left Cingulum and left Uncinate fasciculus in both groups were statistically different. Additionally, we explored possible associations between CSF and DTI markers in the MCI group. Our results indicated several statistically significant associations between DTI metrics and CSF biomarkers within specific white matter tracts. These findings underscore the complexity of imaging and molecular markers associated with MCI.	ADNI; Alzheimer’s disease; Biomarker; Diffusion tensor imaging; Mild cognitive impairment

Epigenome-wide association study of cerebrospinal fluid-based biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease in cognitively normal individuals.	INTRODUCTION: Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are reliable predictors of future AD risk. We investigated whether pre-clinical changes in AD CSF biomarkers are reflected in blood DNA methylation (DNAm) levels in cognitively normal participants. METHODS: We profiled blood-based DNAm with the EPIC array in participants without a diagnosis of cognitive impairment in the Emory Healthy Brain Study (EHBS; N=495) and ADNI (N=122). Their CSF Aβ42, tTau, and pTau levels were quantified using Elecsys immunoassays. We conducted epigenome-wide association studies to assess associations between DNAm and CSF biomarkers of AD. RESULTS: In EHBS, no loci were Bonferroni-significant after adjusting for confounding factors. In ADNI, two loci were significant, but they were not replicated in EHBS. There was little agreement between the top loci from EHBS and ADNI. DISCUSSION: Our study showed little evidence of an association between differential blood-based DNAm and pre-clinical AD CSF biomarkers.

Altered Functional Connectivity and Amyloid Deposition in Posttraumatic Stress Disorder-Associated Cognitive Impairment.	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has been linked to an increased risk of cognitive impairment and dementia, with neuroinflammation, metabolic dysfunction, and neuropathologic markers such as β-amyloid and τ implicated as potential mechanisms. However, the roles of altered functional connectivity and amyloid deposition as biomarkers in the progression of cognitive impairment among patients with PTSD remain unclear, with limited and often conflicting evidence from existing neuroimaging studies. This study examines these neuroimaging markers in patients with PTSD with and without cognitive impairment to better understand the neurobiologic pathways contributing to cognitive decline in PTSD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and Department of Defense (DOD) databases. A cohort of 178 age-matched male subjects was divided into 4 groups: posttraumatic stress disorder with cognitive impairment (PTSD-CI); posttraumatic stress disorder and cognitively normal (PTSD-CN); non-posttraumatic stress disorder with cognitive impairment (NPTSD-CI); and non-posttraumatic stress disorder and cognitively normal (NPTSD-CN). All subjects underwent resting-state functional MRI and amyloid PET imaging, with PTSD diagnosis and cognitive impairment (CI) confirmed through clinical assessments. Functional connectivity was analyzed by using the CONN Toolbox, and amyloid burden was quantified via standardized uptake value ratios. Analyses controlled for demographic and genetic factors, including age, education, RESULTS: Compared with the NPTSD-CN group, the PTSD-CI group showed significantly increased amyloid uptake in the temporal and parietal lobes, with corresponding functional connectivity increase between the bilateral temporal lobes and parietal operculum. In contrast, PTSD-CN patients exhibited no significant amyloid increase but showed increased connectivity between the salience network, postcentral gyri, and sensorimotor areas, and decreased connectivity between the sensorimotor network and anterior cingulate cortex. These distinct patterns suggest differing neurobiologic profiles between PTSD-CI and PTSD-CN patients. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that elevated amyloid and altered connectivity patterns are associated with cognitive impairment in PTSD, particularly in the temporal and parietal regions. In contrast, PTSD without cognitive decline was associated with functional connectivity changes in salience and sensorimotor networks but no increased amyloid deposition. This study underscores the importance of neuroimaging biomarkers in understanding PTSD-related cognitive decline and suggests avenues for further investigation into the mechanistic pathways involved.

The effect of Lewy body (co-)pathology on the clinical and imaging phenotype of amnestic patients.	Lewy body (LB) pathology is present as a co-pathology in ∼50% of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and may even represent the main neuropathologic substrate in a subset of patients with amnestic impairments. However, the degree to which LB pathology affects regional neurodegeneration patterns and clinical trajectories among amnestic patients is not well understood. We studied 865 patients from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative cohort with clinical diagnoses of amnestic mild cognitive impairment (n = 661) or AD dementia (n = 211), who had CSF and FDG-PET data available. CSF samples were analysed for peptide levels of amyloid-β1-42 and p-tau181, and αSyn positivity was evaluated using a novel α-synuclein seed amplification assay. Based on positive/negative results on the different biomarkers, subjects were classified as 'AD-LB-' (n = 304), 'AD+LB-' (n = 335), 'AD+LB+' (n = 158) and 'AD-LB+' (n = 68). We analysed group differences in regional FDG-PET patterns, demographics, APOE4 genotype, baseline and longitudinal domain-specific cognitive profiles (memory versus executive function/visuospatial performance), and risk for developing hallucinations. AD+LB+ showed worse global cognition (Mini-Mental State Examination: P = 0.005) and declined faster (P < 0.001) than AD+LB-, but both groups exhibited similar memory-predominant cognitive profiles. In FDG-PET, AD+LB+ showed more severe hypometabolism compared to AD+LB-, but both groups were characterized by largely identical patterns of temporo-parietal hypometabolism. By contrast, AD-LB+ were less globally impaired (P < 0.001) but characterized by a markedly more dysexecutive and visuospatial profile (P < 0.003) and a strikingly different posterior-occipital pattern of hypometabolism. APOE4 positivity was similar between AD+LB+ and AD+LB- (72% versus 75%, P = 0.28) but lower in AD-LB+ (28%, P < 0.001). On a group level, AD+LB+, AD+LB- and AD-LB+ showed similar risks of developing hallucinations, but patients with LB-like posterior-occipital hypometabolism had a significantly higher risk compared to those showing an AD-typical temporo-parietal pattern (hazard ratio = 2.58, P = 0.004). In conclusion, LB co-pathology in AD was associated with more severe hypometabolism and faster cognitive decline, but did not affect the regional hypometabolic pattern or cognitive profile. By contrast, patients with relatively pure LB pathology showed a more executive/visuospatial-predominant cognitive profile and a distinct posterior-occipital hypometabolism pattern characteristic for LB disease. These findings indicate that the presence of LB pathology may have different consequences for the clinical phenotype depending on AD co-morbidity, which may have critical implications for accurate diagnosis and prognosis of patients presenting with amnestic syndromes.

Predicting conversion in cognitively normal and mild cognitive impairment individuals with machine learning: Is the CSF status still relevant?	INTRODUCTION: Machine learning (ML) helps diagnose the mild cognitive impairment-Alzheimer's disease (MCI-AD) spectrum. However, ML is fed with data unavailable in standard clinical practice. Thus, we tested a novel multi-step ML approach to predict cognitive worsening. METHODS: We selected cognitively normal and MCI participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative dataset and categorized them on total tau/amyloid beta 1-42 ratios. ML was applied to predict the 3-year conversion with standard clinical data (SCD), assess the model's accuracy, and identify the role of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers in this approach. Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) analysis was carried out to explore the automated decisional process. RESULTS: The model achieved 84% accuracy across the entire cohort, 86% in patients with negative CSF, and 88% in individuals with AD-like CSF. SHAP analysis identified differences between CSF-positive and -negative patients in predictors of conversion and cut-offs. CONCLUSIONS: The approach yielded good prediction accuracy using SCD. However, CSF-based categorizations are needed to improve predictive accuracy. HIGHLIGHTS: Machine learning algorithms can predict cognitive decline with standard and routinely used clinical data. Classification according to cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers enhances prediction accuracy. Different cut-offs could be applied to neuropsychological tests to predict conversion.

Impact of sleep disruptions on gray matter structural covariance networks across the Alzheimer's disease continuum.	BACKGROUND: This study explores the impact of sleep disturbances on gray matter structural covariance networks (SCNs) across the Alzheimer's disease (AD) continuum. METHODS: Amyloid-negative participants served as controls, whereas amyloid positive (A+) individuals were categorized into six groups based on cognitive status and sleep quality. SCNs for the default mode network (DMN), salience network (SN), and executive control network (ECN) were derived from T1-weighted magnetic resonance images. RESULTS: In the DMN, increased structural associations were observed in cognitive unimpaired (CU) A+ and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) groups regardless of sleep quality, whereas AD with poor sleep (PS) showed a decrease and AD with normal sleep (NS) an increase. For the ECN, AD-NS showed increased and AD-PS showed reduced associations. In the SN, reduced associations were observed in CU A+ NS and MCI-NS, whereas AD-NS displayed increased associations; only AD-PS had decreased associations. CONCLUSION: Distinct SCN damage patterns between normal and poor sleepers provide insights into sleep disturbances in AD. HIGHLIGHTS: We delineated distinct patterns of structural covariance networks (SCN) impairment across the Alzheimer's disease (AD) continuum, uncovering significant disparities between individuals with normal sleep architecture and those afflicted by sleep disturbances.These observations underscore the pivotal importance of addressing sleep disruptions in AD therapeutics, providing a refined understanding of their detrimental impact on brain networks implicated in the disease.Our investigation epitomizes methodological precision by constructing an AD continuum using amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers to minimize diagnostic heterogeneity, further enhanced by a substantial cohort size that bolsters the robustness and generalizability of our findings.

Distinct CSF α-synuclein aggregation profiles associated with Alzheimer's disease phenotypes and MCI-to-AD conversion.	BACKGROUND: α-Synuclein (α-Syn) pathology is present in 30-50 % of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients, and its interactions with tau proteins may further exacerbate pathological changes in AD. However, the specific role of different aggregation forms of α-Syn in the progression of AD remains unclear. OBJECTIVES: To explore the relationship between various aggregation types of CSF α-Syn and Alzheimer's disease progression. DESIGN: We conducted a retrospective analysis of data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) to examine the association between different α-Syn aggregation forms-Syn0 (no detectable α-Syn aggregates) and Syn1 (α-Syn aggregates detected, resembling those found in Parkinson's disease)-with the pathological and clinical features of AD. Additionally, we evaluated their potential as predictors of conversion from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD. SETTING: The ADNI database. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 250 participants, including 70 cognitively normal controls, 119 patients diagnosed with MCI, and 61 patients diagnosed with AD. MEASUREMENTS: Pearson correlation was employed to assess the relationship between α-Syn levels and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, including total tau (T-tau), phosphorylated tau (p-tau), and amyloid-β RESULTS: Compared with controls, overall MCI and AD patients had elevated α-Syn levels. Notably, in the α-Syn0 group, α-Syn levels were increased in the MCI patients and further increased in AD patients, whereas in the α-Syn1 group, α-Syn levels did not significantly differ across diagnostic groups. Both in the α-Syn0 and α-Syn1 groups, α-Syn levels were found to correlate more strongly with CSF tau levels than with Aβ CONCLUSIONS: CSF α-Syn is associated with tau pathology and neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease. The distinct aggregation profiles of α-Syn serve as valuable biomarkers, offering insights into differing prognoses in AD and aiding in the prediction of early disease progression.

BACKGROUND: Early detection of brain amyloidosis (Aβ+) is crucial for diagnosing Alzheimer'disease (AD) and optimizing patient management, especially in light of emerging treatments. While plasma biomarkers are promising, their combined diagnostic value through specific ratios remains underexplored. In this study, we assess the diagnostic accuracy of plasma pTau isoform (pTau181 and pTau217) to Aβ42 ratios in detecting Aβ+ status. METHODS: This study included 423 participants from the multicenter prospective ALZAN cohort, recruited for cognitive complaints. Aβ+ status was determined using cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers. The confirmatory cohort comprises 1,176 patient samples from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), with Aβ+ status determined by positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. Plasma biomarkers (pTau181, pTau217, Aβ40, Aβ42) were measured using immunoassays and mass spectrometry, with specific ratios calculated. In the ALZAN cohort, the impact of confounding factors such as age, renal function, ApoE4 status, body mass index, and the delay between blood collection and processing was also evaluated to assess their influence on biomarker concentrations and diagnostic performance. The primary outcome was the diagnostic performance of plasma biomarkers and their ratios for detecting Aβ+ status. Secondary outcomes in the ALZAN cohort included the proportion of patients classified as low, intermediate, or high risk for Aβ+ using a two-cutoff approach. FINDINGS: In ALZAN the pTau181/Aβ42 ratio matched the diagnostic performance of pTau217 (AUC of 0.911 (0.882-0.940) vs. 0.909 (0.879-0.939), P=0.85). The pTau217/Aβ42 ratio demonstrated the highest diagnostic accuracy, with an AUC of 0.927 (0.900-0.954). Both ratios effectively mitigated confounding factors, such as variations in renal function, and were also efficient in identifying Aβ+ status in individuals with early cognitive decline. Diagnostic accuracy of ratios vs. individual measurement was confirmed in the ADNI cohort. In ALZAN, using two-cutoff workflows with pTau217/Aβ42 instead of pTau217 alone reduced the intermediate-risk zone from ∼16% to ∼8%, enhancing stratification for clinical decision-making. INTERPRETATION: The pTau217/Aβ42 ratio demonstrated improved diagnostic performance for detecting Aβ+ compared to individual biomarkers, potentially reducing diagnostic uncertainty. These findings suggest that plasma biomarker ratios could be useful; however, further validation in independent and diverse clinical settings is necessary before broader clinical implementation.

INTRODUCTION: Apolipoprotein E ε4 (APOE ε4) bring the higher risk of Alzheimer' Disease (AD). It is essential to evaluate whether the diagnostic performances and critical values of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers are influenced by APOE ε4, which has guiding significance for the clinical practical application. METHODS: The differences in CSF biomarkers and their performances between APOE ε4 carriers and non-carriers in distinguishing AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and preclinical AD from normal controls (NCs) were analyzed. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated to compare the area under the curve (AUC) between APOE ε4 carriers and non-carriers, as well as the critical values corresponding Youden Index. RESULTS: In a cross sectional convenience sample of 1610 participants, lower Aβ42 and Aβ42/Aβ40 and higher p-Tau 181/Aβ42 in CSF were observed among APOE ε4 carriers than non-carriers in NC, MCI, and AD groups (P< 0.05). The performance of CSF p-tau/Aβ42 in distinguishing MCI from NC among APOE ε4 carriers was superior to non-carriers [AUC: 0.714 (95%CI: 0.673- 0.752) vs 0.600 (95%CI: 0.564- 0.634), P< 0.001], although it was similar in distinguishing AD from NC between APOE ε4 carriers and non-carriers [AUC: 0.874 (95%CI: 0.835-0.906) vs 0.876 (95%CI: 0.843- 0.904)]. In the longitudinal cohort of 254 participants, the association of CSF Aβ42, Aβ42/Aβ40 and p-Tau181/Aβ42 with cognitive decline were stronger in APOE ε4 carriers compared to non-carriers (P< 0.05). Meanwhile, the critical values were different depending on APOE genotype. DISCUSSION: The CSF level of p-Tau181/Aβ42 was significantly different between APOE ε4 carriers and non-carriers at different stages of AD. The results indicate that the performances of CSF biomarkers are influenced by APOE ε4, which should be considered in the practical application.

Cerebrospinal fluid β2-microglobulin promotes the tau pathology through microglia-astrocyte communication in Alzheimer's disease.	BACKGROUND: Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) β2-microglobulin (β2M) has been demonstrated as an important factor in β-amyloid (Aβ) neurotoxicity and a potential target for Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, more investigation is required to ascertain the relationship between β2M and glial activities in AD pathogenesis. METHODS: In this study, 211 participants from the Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) with CSF and Plasma β2M, CSF glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (sTREM2), Aβ RESULTS: CSF β2M concentration decreased with amyloid in stage 1 compared with stage 0 and increased with tau pathology and neurodegeneration in stage 2 and SNAP compared with stage 1. Moreover, CSF β2M level was positively correlated with the Aβ CONCLUSIONS: CSF β2M is dynamic in AD pathology and associated with neuroinflammation. CSF GFAP might mediate the association between β2M and tau pathology, complementing the existing research on the effect of β2M in AD pathology and providing a new perspective on treatment.

A visual scale to rate amygdalar atrophy on MRI.	BACKGROUND: Visual rating scales are routinely used in clinical radiology to assess brain atrophy on scans of patients with suspected neurodegenerative conditions. Limbic predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy (LATE) has recently been described, featuring early and severe atrophy of the amygdala. However, there is currently no scoring system specifically designed to assess amygdalar atrophy on MRI. OBJECTIVES: to develop and validate a visual rating scale for amygdalar atrophy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Stringent criteria were developed for no, mild/moderate, and severe amygdalar atrophy based on axial and coronal volumetric T1-weighted MRI scans. Inter- and intra-rater reliabilities were estimated by three independent expert neuroradiologists in 100 randomly selected scans from the Geneva Memory Center cohort selected to be representative of the variability of medial temporal atrophy. Convergent validity was evaluated versus amygdalar volumes extracted by FreeSurfer on 1943 consecutive patients. Criterion validity versus autopsy-confirmed LATE neuropathologic changes were studied in the pathological subset of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort (N = 96). RESULTS: Intra- and inter-rater agreements of amygdalar visual ratings were between substantial and almost perfect (weighted Cohen's Kappa 0.71 to 0.93). Visual ratings were strongly associated with amygdalar volumes (p ≤ 0.001 on the Kruskal-Wallis test). LATE neuropathologic changes were associated with visual ratings of amygdalar atrophy (p = 0.057 on a test for trend). CONCLUSION: The proposed visual amygdalar atrophy scale is a reliable and valid tool to assess amygdalar atrophy on MRI and can be a useful adjunct in routine radiological reporting. KEY POINTS: Question Assessment of amygdalar atrophy is crucial for diagnosing neurodegenerative diseases, as the limbic predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy, yet no validated visual rating scale exists. Findings The proposed amygdalar atrophy scale demonstrated high intra-rater and inter-rater reliability, strong correlation with amygdalar volumetry, and association with limbic predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy (LATE). Clinical relevance The amygdalar atrophy scale provides a reliable practical assessment tool that enhances diagnostic accuracy for dementia-related conditions, particularly aiding in identifying limbic predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy.

Random survival forest model for early prediction of Alzheimer's disease conversion in early and late Mild cognitive impairment stages.	With a clinical trial failure rate of 99.6% for Alzheimer's Disease (AD), early diagnosis is critical. Machine learning (ML) models have shown promising results in early AD prediction, with survival ML models outperforming typical classifiers by providing probabilities of disease progression over time. This study utilized various ML survival models to predict the time-to-conversion to AD for early (eMCI) and late (lMCI) Mild Cognitive Impairment stages, considering their different progression rates. ADNI data, consisting of 291 eMCI and 546 lMCI cases, was preprocessed to handle missing values and data imbalance. The models used included Random Survival Forest (RSF), Extra Survival Trees (XST), Gradient Boosting (GB), Survival Tree (ST), Cox-net, and Cox Proportional Hazard (CoxPH). We evaluated cognitive, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, and neuroimaging modalities, both individually and combined, to identify the most influential features. Our results indicate that RSF outperformed traditional CoxPH and other ML models. For eMCI, RSF trained on multimodal data achieved a C-Index of 0.90 and an IBS of 0.10. For lMCI, the C-Index was 0.82 and the IBS was 0.16. Cognitive tests showed a statistically significant improvement over other modalities, underscoring their reliability in early prediction. Furthermore, RSF-generated individual survival curves from baseline data facilitate clinical decision-making, aiding clinicians in developing personalized treatment plans and implementing preventive measures to slow or prevent AD progression in prodromal stages.

Deep learning reveals pathology-confirmed neuroimaging signatures in Alzheimer's, vascular and Lewy body dementias.	Concurrent neurodegenerative and vascular pathologies pose a diagnostic challenge in the clinical setting, with histopathology remaining the definitive modality for dementia-type diagnosis. To address this clinical challenge, we introduce a neuropathology-based, data-driven, multi-label deep-learning framework to identify and quantify in vivo biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease (AD), vascular dementia (VD) and Lewy body dementia (LBD) using antemortem T1-weighted MRI scans of 423 demented and 361 control participants from National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center and Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative datasets. Based on the best-performing deep-learning model, explainable heat maps were extracted to visualize disease patterns, and the novel Deep Signature of Pathology Atrophy REcognition (DeepSPARE) indices were developed, where a higher DeepSPARE score indicates more brain alterations associated with that specific pathology. A substantial discrepancy in clinical and neuropathological diagnosis was observed in the demented patients: 71% had more than one pathology, but 67% were diagnosed clinically as AD only. Based on these neuropathological diagnoses and leveraging cross-validation principles, the deep-learning model achieved the best performance, with a balanced accuracy of 0.844, 0.839 and 0.623 for AD, VD and LBD, respectively, and was used to generate the explainable deep-learning heat maps and DeepSPARE indices. The explainable deep-learning heat maps revealed distinct neuroimaging brain alteration patterns for each pathology: (i) the AD heat map highlighted bilateral hippocampal regions; (ii) the VD heat map emphasized white matter regions; and (iii) the LBD heat map exposed occipital alterations. The DeepSPARE indices were validated by examining their associations with cognitive testing and neuropathological and neuroimaging measures using linear mixed-effects models. The DeepSPARE-AD index was associated with Mini-Mental State Examination, the Trail Making Test B, memory, hippocampal volume, Braak stages, Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD) scores and Thal phases [false-discovery rate (FDR)-adjusted P < 0.05]. The DeepSPARE-VD index was associated with white matter hyperintensity volume and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (FDR-adjusted P < 0.001), and the DeepSPARE-LBD index was associated with Lewy body stages (FDR-adjusted P < 0.05). The findings were replicated in an out-of-sample Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative dataset by testing associations with cognitive, imaging, plasma and CSF measures. CSF and plasma tau phosphorylated at threonine-181 (pTau181) were significantly associated with DeepSPARE-AD in the AD and mild cognitive impairment amyloid-β positive (AD/MCIΑβ+) group (FDR-adjusted P < 0.001), and CSF α-synuclein was associated solely with DeepSPARE-LBD (FDR-adjusted P = 0.036). Overall, these findings demonstrate the advantages of our innovative deep-learning framework in detecting antemortem neuroimaging signatures linked to different pathologies. The newly deep-learning-derived DeepSPARE indices are precise, pathology-sensitive and single-valued non-invasive neuroimaging metrics, bridging the traditional widely available in vivo T1 imaging with histopathology.

CSF inflammatory cytokines as prognostic indicators for cognitive decline across Alzheimer's disease spectrum.	BACKGROUND: A growing body of evidence suggests that neuroinflammation contributes actively to pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and promotes AD progression. The predictive value of neuroinflammatory biomarkers for disease-staging or estimating disease progression is not well understood. In this study, we investigate the diagnostic and prognostic utility of inflammatory biomarkers in combination with conventional AD biomarkers. METHODS: We included 258 participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) who had CSF biomarkers of β-Amyloid (Aβ), tau, and inflammation. The primary outcome of interest was clinically meaningful cognitive decline (CMCD) as defined by an increase of ≥4 on the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale Cognitive Subscore 11 (ADAS-11, scores 0-70, higher scores indicate worse cognition). Predictor variables were categorized as demographics (D; age, sex, and education), genetic (APOE4 status (A)), inflammatory biomarkers (I), and classic (C) cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers of Aβ and p-tau181. Simultaneous inclusion of eleven CSF inflammatory biomarkers as covariates in logistic regression models was examined to assess improvements in classifying baseline clinical diagnoses (cognitively normal (CN), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), Dementia) and predicting individuals with and without CMCD over one year of follow-up. RESULTS: At 1-year follow up, 27.1% of participants experienced CMCD. Inclusion of inflammatory biomarkers improved baseline classification of CN vs MCI as well as CN vs Dementia for models including D and A variables (DA; both CONCLUSIONS: Addition of CSF inflammatory biomarkers to CSF biomarkers of AD can improve diagnostic accuracy of clinical disease stage at baseline and add incremental value to AD biomarkers for prediction of cognitive decline.

Graph Convolutional Network for AD and MCI Diagnosis Utilizing Peripheral DNA Methylation: Réseau de neurones en graphes pour le diagnostic de la MA et du TCL à l'aide de la méthylation de l'ADN périphérique.	OBJECTIVE: Blood DNA methylation (DNAm) alterations have been widely reported in the onset and progression of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD); however, DNAm is underutilized as a diagnostic biomarker for these diseases. We aimed to evaluate the diagnostic performance of DNAm for MCI and AD, both individually and in combination with well-established AD biosignatures. METHODS: A total of 1,891 blood samples from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) studies were used to identify potential candidate DNAm biomarkers. Multimodal clinical data from 635 samples (normal control (NC), RESULTS: After feature selection, 17 DNAm sites were selected for subsequent analysis. Remarkable differences in DNAm levels were observed at the screened DNAm loci in all three cohorts. Adopting DNAm features into multimodal models significantly improved the classification performance for three dichotomous subtasks (NC vs. non-NC, MCI vs. non-MCI, and AD vs. non-AD), especially when combined with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) features for NC (area under the curve (AUC): 0.8534) and MCI classification (AUC: 0.7675). A weak correlation between DNAm and both magnetic resonance imaging and CSF features in the NC and MCI cohorts suggests good complementarity between modalities (correlation coefficient ≤0.2). CONCLUSIONS: Our study offers new insights into peripheral DNAm in MCI and AD and suggests promising diagnostic performance of models integrating epigenomics, imaging, or CSF biomarkers. PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY TITLE: Using Machine Learning and Blood-Based Genetic Markers to Help Diagnose Mild Cognitive Impairment and Alzheimer's Disease. Why Was the Study Done? Memory issues range from mild cognitive impairment, where people have more problems thinking or remembering than their peers, to Alzheimer's disease, which profoundly affects memory, thinking and independence. Accurate diagnosis is essential for disease intervention. Researchers have found that DNA methylation, which regulates gene expression, is altered in the blood of people with cognitive disorders. Despite its potential, DNA methylation hasn't been widely used for diagnosis. Our study investigated its effectiveness in diagnosing both mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's, either alone or alongside other indicators. How we did the study? We analyzed blood samples from 1,891 people in an Alzheimer's disease research dataset to find potential DNA methylation indicators. We then focused on 635 people with comprehensive clinical data, including healthy people, those with mild cognitive impairment, and Alzheimer's patients. We built machine learning models using many types of data, such as DNA methylation, brain imaging, or cerebrospinal fluid analysis and evaluated their diagnostic performance. These models excel at detecting subtle patterns in data that are not obvious to humans. What We Found? Our study identified 17 key DNA methylation markers that are valuable for diagnosis. We found that using DNA methylation data along with other clinical data, such as cerebrospinal fluid testing, significantly improved the ability to correctly classify who has cognitive disorder. Our results show that DNA methylation can provide additional information not available from other tests, highlighting its potential as a diagnostic tool. What This Means for You? Our study sheds new light on the potential of blood DNA methylation to diagnose mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease. Our models, which combine genetic information with brain imaging or cerebrospinal fluid testing, show promise in diagnosing cognitive disorders.

L’adoption des caractéristiques de la mADN dans les modèles multimodaux a considérablement amélioré les performances de classification à trois sous-tâches dichotomiques (GT vs non-GT, TCL vs non-TCL et MA vs non-MA), en particulier lorsqu’elles sont combinées avec les caractéristiques du liquide céphalorachidien (LCR) dans le GT (aire sous la courbe [ASC] : 0,8534) et la classification du TCL (ASC : 0,7675). Une faible corrélation entre la mADN et les caractéristiques de l’imagerie par résonance magnétique et du LCR dans les cohortes GT et TCL montre une bonne complémentarité entre les modalités (coefficient de corrélation ≤ 0,2). CONCLUSIONS: notre étude offre de nouvelles pistes concernant l’ADNm périphérique dans les cas de TCL et de MA et permet d’envisager des performances diagnostiques prometteuses pour les modèles intégrant l’épigénomique, l’imagerie ou les biomarqueurs du LCR.

Plasma pTau217 ratio predicts continuous regional brain tau accumulation in amyloid-positive early Alzheimer's disease.	BACKGROUND: This study examines whether phosphorylated plasma Tau217 ratio (pTau217R) can predict tau accumulation in different brain regions, as measured by positron emission tomography (PET) standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR), for staging Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHODS: Plasma pTau217R was measured using immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry. Models for predicting tau PET SUVR, developed with 144 early AD individuals using [ RESULTS: The pTau217R-based model predicted tau levels up to an SUVR of 2 in multiple brain regions, effectively assessing tau status at different tau levels with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve areas of 0.84-0.95 in VS1 and 0.71-0.88 in VS2 (using a different tracer). It reduced PET scan needs by 65% while maintaining 95% sensitivity. DISCUSSION: PTau217R reliably predicts regional tau accumulation in early AD, reducing reliance on tau PET scans and broadening its clinical application. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT03887455 (ClarityAD) HIGHLIGHTS: Developed a model using plasma pTau217R to predict tau levels across brain regions. pTau217R model outperformed models based on clinical, MRI, and other blood biomarkers. The model reliably predicted tau levels exceeding tau positivity and higher thresholds. Screening with pTau217R could reduce tau PET scans by 65% at 95% sensitivity. pTau217R model aids in disease staging and monitoring in early AD.

Prediction, prognosis and monitoring of neurodegeneration at biobank-scale via machine learning and imaging.	BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) are the most common neurodegenerative conditions. These central nervous system disorders impact both the structure and function of the brain and may lead to imaging changes that precede symptoms. Patients with ADRD or PD have long asymptomatic phases that exhibit significant heterogeneity. Hence, quantitative measures that can provide early disease indicators are necessary to improve patient stratification, clinical care, and clinical trial design. This work uses machine learning techniques to derive such a quantitative marker from T1-weighted (T1w) brain Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). METHODS: In this retrospective study, we developed machine learning (ML) based disease-specific scores based on T1w brain MRI utilizing Parkinson's Disease Progression Marker Initiative (PPMI) and Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohorts. We evaluated the potential of ML-based scores for early diagnosis, prognosis, and monitoring of ADRD and PD in an independent large-scale population-based longitudinal cohort, UK Biobank. FINDINGS: 1,826 dementia images from 731 participants, 3,161 healthy control images from 925 participants from the ADNI cohort, 684 PD images from 319 participants, and 232 healthy control images from 145 participants from the PPMI cohort were used to train machine learning models. The classification performance is 0.94 [95% CI: 0.93-0.96] area under the ROC Curve (AUC) for ADRD detection and 0.63 [95% CI: 0.57-0.71] for PD detection using 790 extracted structural brain features. The most predictive regions include the hippocampus and temporal brain regions in ADRD and the substantia nigra in PD. The normalized ML model's probabilistic output (ADRD and PD imaging scores) was evaluated on 42,835 participants with imaging data from the UK Biobank. There are 66 cases for ADRD and 40 PD cases whose T1 brain MRI is available during pre-diagnostic phases. For diagnosis occurrence events within 5 years, the integrated survival model achieves a time-dependent AUC of 0.86 [95% CI: 0.80-0.92] for dementia and 0.89 [95% CI: 0.85-0.94] for PD. ADRD imaging score is strongly associated with dementia-free survival (hazard ratio (HR) 1.76 [95% CI: 1.50-2.05] per S.D. of imaging score), and PD imaging score shows association with PD-free survival (hazard ratio 2.33 [95% CI: 1.55-3.50]) in our integrated model. HR and prevalence increased stepwise over imaging score quartiles for PD, demonstrating heterogeneity. As a proxy for diagnosis, we validated AD/PD polygenic risk scores of 42,835 subjects against the imaging scores, showing a highly significant association after adjusting for covariates. In both the PPMI and ADNI cohorts, the scores are associated with clinical assessments, including the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog), and pathological markers, which include amyloid and tau. Finally, imaging scores are associated with polygenic risk scores for multiple diseases. Our results suggest that we can use imaging scores to assess the genetic architecture of such disorders in the future. INTERPRETATION: Our study demonstrates the use of quantitative markers generated using machine learning techniques for ADRD and PD. We show that disease probability scores obtained from brain structural features are useful for early detection, prognosis prediction, and monitoring disease progression.

Unveiling Potential Biomarkers in Cerebrospinal Fluid for Amyloid Pathological Positivity in Non-Demented Individuals.	BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaque accumulation and neurofibrillary tangles. The recent approval of anti-amyloid therapeutic medications highlights the crucial need for early detection of Aβ pathological abnormalities in individuals without dementia to facilitate timely intervention and treatment. OBJECTIVE: The primary aim of this study was to identify cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers strongly associated with Aβ pathological positivity in a non-demented cohort and evaluate their clinical values. METHODS: A comprehensive analysis was conducted on 51 CSF proteins (excluding Aβ42, pTau, and Tau) obtained from 474 non-demented participants sourced from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. By utilizing the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression, we identified potential proteins indicative of Aβ pathological positivity and evaluated their performance in tracking longitudinal pathological progression. RESULTS: Our LASSO analysis unveiled three candidates: apolipoprotein E (APOE), chitinase-3-like protein 1 (CHI3L1), and SPARC-related modular calcium-binding protein 1 (SMOC1). While SMOC1 did not correlate with Aβ42-related cognitive alterations, it displayed better abilities in discriminating both CSF-Aβ positivity and Aβ-positron emission tomography (PET) positivity than the other two candidates. It could precisely predict longitudinal Aβ-PET status conversion. Notably, SMOC1 was the only protein showing associations with longitudinal Aβ-PET trajectory and enhancing the diagnostic accuracy of Aβ42. The assessment of combined Aβ42 and SMOC1 yielded valuable clinical insights. CONCLUSION: Our findings elucidated SMOC1 as a potential biomarker for detecting Aβ abnormalities. Aβ42 combining SMOC1 offered critical implications in AD pathological diagnosis and management.

This research examined the distinctions in brain network characteristics among individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and a control group. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and mini-mental state examination (MMSE) data were retrieved from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ANDI) database, comprising 40 subjects in each group. Correlation maps for evaluating brain network connectivity were generated using fractal dimension (FD) analysis, a method capable of quantifying morphological changes in cortical and cerebral regions. Employing graph theory, each parcellated brain region was represented as a node, and edges between nodes were utilized to compute small-world network properties for each group. In the comparison between control and AD demonstrated the significantly lower FD values (P<0.05) in temporal lobe, motor cortex, part of occipital and parietal, hippocampus, amygdala, and entorhinal cortex, which present the atrophy. Similarly, comparing control group to MCIs, regions closely associated with memory, such as the hippocampus, showed significantly lower FD values. Furthermore, both AD and MCI groups displayed diminished connectivity and decreased network efficiency. In conclusion, fractal dimension (FD) analysis illustrate the progression of structural declination from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Additionally, structural small-world network analysis presents itself as a potential method for assessing network efficiency and the progression of AD. Moving forward, further clinical assessments are warranted to validate the findings observed in this study.

Novel plasma protein biomarkers: A time-dependent predictive model for Alzheimer's disease.	BACKGROUND: The accurate prediction of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is crucial for the efficient management of its progression. The objective of this research was to construct a new risk predictive model utilizing novel plasma protein biomarkers for predicting AD incidence in the future and analyze their potential biological correlation with AD incidence. METHODS: A cohort of 440 participants aged 60 years and older from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) longitudinal cohort was utilized. The baseline plasma proteomics data was employed to conduct Cox regression, LASSO regression, and cross-validation to identify plasma protein signatures predictive of AD risk. Subsequently, a multivariable Cox proportional hazards model based on these signatures was constructed. The performance of the risk prediction model was evaluated using time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (t-ROC) curves and Kaplan-Meier curves. Additionally, we analyzed the correlations between protein signature expression in plasma and predicted AD risk, the time of AD onset, the expression of protein signatures in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), the expression of CSF and plasma biomarkers, and APOE ε4 genotypes. Colocalization and Mendelian randomization analyses was conducted to investigate the association between protein features and AD risk. GEO database was utilized to analyze the differential expression of protein features in the blood and brain of AD patients. RESULTS: We identified seven protein signatures (APOE, CGA, CRP, CCL26, CCL20, NRCAM, and PYY) that independently predicted AD incidence in the future. The risk prediction model demonstrated area under the ROC curve (AUC) values of 0.77, 0.76, and 0.77 for predicting AD incidence at 4, 6, and 8 years, respectively. Furthermore, the model remained stable in the range of the 3rd to the 12th year (ROC ≥ 0.74). The low-risk group, as defined by the model, exhibited a significantly later AD onset compared to the high-risk group (P < 0.0001). Moreover, all protein signatures exhibited significant correlations with AD risk (P < 0.001) and the time of AD onset (P < 0.01). There was no strong correlation between the protein expression levels in plasma and CSF, as well as AD CSF biomarkers. APOE, CGA, and CRP exhibited significantly lower expression levels in APOE ε4 positive individuals (P < 0.05). Additionally, colocalization analysis reveals a significant association between AD and SNP loci in APOE. Mendelian randomization analysis shows a negative correlation between NRCAM and AD risk. Transcriptomic analysis indicates a significant downregulation of NRCAM and PYY in the peripheral blood of AD patients (P < 0.01), while APOE, CGA, and NRCAM are significantly downregulated in the brains of AD patients (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: Our research has successfully identified protein signatures in plasma as potential risk biomarkers that can independently predict AD onset in the future. Notably, this risk prediction model has demonstrated commendable predictive performance and stability over time. These findings underscore the promising utility of plasma protein signatures in dynamically predicting the risk of AD, thereby facilitating early screening and intervention strategies.

Clarifying the association of CSF Aβ, tau, BACE1, and neurogranin with AT(N) stages in Alzheimer disease.	BACKGROUND: Current AT(N) stratification for Alzheimer's disease (AD) accounts for complex combinations of amyloid (A), tau proteinopathy (T) and neurodegeneration (N) signatures. Understanding the transition between these different stages is a major challenge, especially in view of the recent development of disease modifying therapy. METHODS: This is an observational study, CSF levels of Tau, pTau181, pTau217, Aβ38/40/42, sAPPα/β, BACE1 and neurogranin were measured in the BALTAZAR cohort of cognitively impaired patients and in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Biomarkers levels were related to the AT(N) framework. (A) and (T) were defined in BALTAZAR with CSF Aβ42/40 ratio and pTau217 respectively, and in ADNI with amyloid and tau PET. (N) was defined using total CSF tau in both cohorts. RESULTS: As expected, CSF Aβ42 decreased progressively with the AD continuum going from the A-T-N- to the A + T + N + profile. On the other hand, Tau and pTau181 increased progressively with the disease. The final transition from A + T + N- to A + T + N + led to a sharp increase in Aβ38, Aβ42 and sAPP levels. Synaptic CSF biomarkers BACE1 and neurogranin, were lowest in the initial A + T-N- stage and increased with T + and N + . CSF pTau181 and total tau were closely related in both cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: The early transition to an A + phenotype (A + T-N-) primarily impacts synaptic function. The appearance of T + and then N + is associated with a significant and progressive increase in pathological Alzheimer's disease biomarkers. Our main finding is that CSF pTau181 is an indicator of N + rather than T + , and that N + is associated with elevated levels of BACE1 protein and beta-amyloid peptides. This increase may potentially fuel the amyloid cascade in a positive feedback loop. Overall, our data provide further insights into understanding the interconnected pathological processes of amyloid, tau, and neurodegeneration underlying Alzheimer's disease.

Performance of Plasma Biomarkers Combined with Structural MRI to Identify Candidate Participants for Alzheimer's Disease-Modifying Therapy.	BACKGROUND: Recently, two monoclonal antibodies that lower amyloid plaques have shown promising results for the treatment of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and mild dementia due to Alzheimer's disease (AD). These treatments require the identification of cognitively impaired older adults with biomarker evidence of AD pathology using CSF biomarkers or amyloid-PET. Previous studies showed plasma biomarkers (plasma Aβ42/Aβ40 and p-tau181) and hippocampal volume from structural MRI correlated with brain amyloid pathology. We hypothesized plasma biomarkers with hippocampal volume would identify patients who are suitable candidates for disease-modifying therapy. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the performance of plasma AD biomarkers and hippocampal atrophy to detect MCI or AD with amyloid pathology confirmed by amyloid-PET or CSF biomarkers in ADNI. DESIGN: A cross-sectional and longitudinal study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Data were from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. Participants were aged 55-90 years old with plasma biomarker and structural MRI brain data. MEASUREMENTS: The optimum cut-off point for plasma Aβ42/Aβ40, p-tau181, and NFL and the performance of combined biomarkers and hippocampal atrophy for detecting cognitive impairment with brain amyloid pathology were evaluated. The association between baseline plasma biomarkers and clinical progression, defined by CDR-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) and diagnostic conversion over two years, was evaluated using a Weibull time-to-event analysis. RESULTS: A total of 428 participants were included; 167 had normal cognition, 245 had MCI, and 16 had mild AD. Among MCI and AD, 140 participants had elevated amyloid levels by PET or CSF. Plasma Aβ42/Aβ40 provided the best accuracy (sensitivity 79%, specificity 66%, AUC 0.73, 95% CI 0.68-0.77) to detect drug candidate participants at baseline. Combined plasma Aβ42/40, p-tau181, and hippocampal atrophy increased the specificity for diagnosis (96%), but had lower sensitivity (34%), and AUC (0.65). Hippocampal atrophy combined with the abnormal plasma p-tau181 or hippocampal atrophy alone showed high sensitivity to detect clinical progression (by CDR-SB worsening) of the drug-candidate participants within the next 2 years (sensitivity 93% and 89%, respectively). CONCLUSION: Plasma biomarkers and structural MRI can help identify patients who are currently eligible for anti-amyloid treatment and are likely to progress clinically, in cases where amyloid-PET or CSF biomarkers are not available.

Dynamic functional network connectivity and its association with lipid metabolism in Alzheimer's disease.	AIMS: The study aims to examine the changing trajectory characteristics of dynamic functional network connectivity (dFNC) and its correlation with lipid metabolism-related factors across the Alzheimer's disease (AD) spectrum populations. METHODS: Data from 242 AD spectrum subjects, including biological, neuroimaging, and general cognition, were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative for this cross-sectional study. The study utilized a sliding-window approach to assess whole-brain dFNC, investigating group differences and associations with biological and cognitive factors. Abnormal dFNC was used in the classification of AD spectrum populations by support vector machine. Mediation analysis was performed to explore the relationships between lipid-related indicators, dFNC, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, and cognitive performance. RESULTS: Significant group difference concerning were observed in relation to APOE-ε4 status, CSF biomarkers, and cognitive scores. Two reoccurring connectivity states were identified: state-1 characterized by frequent but weak connections, and state-II characterized by less frequent but strong connections. Pre-AD subjects exhibited a preference for spending more time in state-I, whereas AD patients tended remain in state-II for longer periods. Group difference in dFNC was primarily found between AD and non-AD participants within each state. The dFNC of state-I yielded strong power to distinguish AD from other groups compared with state-II. APOE-ε4 CONCLUSION: The dysfunction of dFNC temporal-spatial patterns and increased cognition in individuals with APOE-ε4, high polygenic score, and higher serum lipid levels shed light on the lipid-related mechanisms of dynamic network reorganization in AD.

A prediction model of dementia conversion for mild cognitive impairment by combining plasma pTau181 and structural imaging features.	AIMS: The early stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are no longer insurmountable. Therefore, identifying at-risk individuals is of great importance for precise treatment. We developed a model to predict cognitive deterioration in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). METHODS: Based on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database, we constructed models in a derivation cohort of 761 participants with MCI (138 of whom developed dementia at the 36th month) and verified them in a validation cohort of 353 cognitively normal controls (54 developed MCI and 19 developed dementia at the 36th month). In addition, 1303 participants with available AD cerebrospinal fluid core biomarkers were selected to clarify the ability of the model to predict AD core features. We assessed 32 parameters as candidate predictors, including clinical information, blood biomarkers, and structural imaging features, and used multivariable logistic regression analysis to develop our prediction model. RESULTS: Six independent variables of MCI deterioration were identified: apolipoprotein E ε4 allele status, lower Mini-Mental State Examination scores, higher levels of plasma pTau181, smaller volumes of the left hippocampus and right amygdala, and a thinner right inferior temporal cortex. We established an easy-to-use risk heat map and risk score based on these risk factors. The area under the curve (AUC) for both internal and external validations was close to 0.850. Furthermore, the AUC was above 0.800 in identifying participants with high brain amyloid-β loads. Calibration plots demonstrated good agreement between the predicted probability and actual observations in the internal and external validations. CONCLUSION: We developed and validated an accurate prediction model for dementia conversion in patients with MCI. Simultaneously, the model predicts AD-specific pathological changes. We hope that this model will contribute to more precise clinical treatment and better healthcare resource allocation.	Alzheimer's disease; MCI; MRI; biomarker; pTau181; prediction model

Plasma miRNAs across the Alzheimer's disease continuum: Relationship to central biomarkers.	INTRODUCTION: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play important roles in gene expression regulation and Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. METHODS: We investigated the association between baseline plasma miRNAs and central AD biomarkers from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI; N = 803): amyloid, tau, and neurodegeneration (A/T/N). Differentially expressed miRNAs and their targets were identified, followed by pathway enrichment analysis. Machine learning approaches were applied to investigate the role of miRNAs as blood biomarkers. RESULTS: We identified nine, two, and eight miRNAs significantly associated with A/T/N positivity, respectively. We identified 271 genes targeted by amyloid-related miRNAs with estrogen signaling receptor-mediated signaling among the enriched pathways. Additionally, 220 genes targeted by neurodegeneration-related miRNAs showed enrichment in pathways including the insulin growth factor 1 pathway. The classification performance of demographic information for A/T/N positivity was increased up to 9% with the inclusion of miRNAs. DISCUSSION: Plasma miRNAs were associated with central A/T/N biomarkers, highlighting their potential as blood biomarkers. HIGHLIGHTS: We performed association analysis of microRNAs (miRNAs) with amyloid/tau/neurodegeneration (A/T/N) biomarker positivity. We identified dysregulated miRNAs for A/T/N biomarker positivity. We identified Alzheimer's disease biomarker-specific/common pathways related to miRNAs. miRNAs improved the classification for A/T/N positivity by up to 9%. Our study highlights the potential of miRNAs as blood biomarkers.	Alzheimer's disease; amyloid; biomarkers; classification; microRNAs; neurodegeneration; plasma; tau

Connecting genomic and proteomic signatures of amyloid burden in the brain.	BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) has a high heritable component characteristic of complex diseases, yet many of the genetic risk factors remain unknown. We combined genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on amyloid endophenotypes measured in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and positron emission tomography (PET) as surrogates of amyloid pathology, which may be helpful to understand the underlying biology of the disease. METHODS: We performed a meta-analysis of GWAS of CSF Aβ42 and PET measures combining six independent cohorts (n=2,076). Due to the opposite effect direction of Aβ phenotypes in CSF and PET measures, only genetic signals in the opposite direction were considered for analysis (n=376,599). Polygenic risk scores (PRS) were calculated and evaluated for AD status and amyloid endophenotypes. We then searched the CSF proteome signature of brain amyloidosis using SOMAscan proteomic data (Ace cohort, n=1,008) and connected it with GWAS results of RESULTS: After filtering the meta-GWAS, we observed genome-wide significance in the rs429358- CONCLUSIONS: The strategy of combining CSF and PET amyloid endophenotypes GWAS with CSF proteome analyses might be effective for identifying signals associated with the AD pathological process and elucidate causative molecular mechanisms behind the amyloid mobilization in AD.

Baseline serum glutamate: Implications for diagnosis and prediction in mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative.	PURPOSE: Numerous studies have highlighted a close link between metabolic imbalances and Alzheimer's Disease (AD). The advancement of metabolomics has recently enabled the exploration of characteristic metabolic changes associated with AD. Studies indicate that serum glutamate (Glu) levels may correlate with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD. This study aims to further elucidate the characteristics of baseline serum Glu levels in MCI and AD. METHODS: This study included 783 participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative-1 (ADNI-1) cohort, categorized into cognitively normal (CN, n = 224), stable MCI (sMCI, n = 181), progressive MCI (pMCI, n = 193), and AD (n = 185). The study aimed to analyze the diagnostic value of baseline serum Glu, to explore its predictive capability for the progression from CN to MCI or AD, and from MCI to AD, and to analyze the relationship between serum Glu and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers and cognitive functions in different diagnostic groups. RESULTS: Compared to the CN and sMCI groups, the pMCI group showed significantly lower levels of serum Glu, and the AD group also had lower Glu levels compared to the sMCI group. However, serum Glu did not show significant diagnostic value for MCI and AD. Lower levels of serum Glu could predict the progression from MCI to AD. CONCLUSION: Serum Glu levels can predict the progression from MCI to AD, suggesting that it could provide new insights into the pathophysiological mechanisms of AD. However, serum Glu may not be an ideal peripheral biomarker for AD.	Alzheimer’s Disease; Glutamate; Mild Cognitive Impairment

Predicting CDR status over 36 months with a recall-based digital cognitive biomarker.	INTRODUCTION: Word-list recall tests are routinely used for cognitive assessment, and process scoring may improve their accuracy. We examined whether Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog) derived, process-based digital cognitive biomarkers (DCBs) at baseline predicted Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) longitudinally and compared them to standard metrics. METHODS: Analyses were performed with Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) data from 330 participants (mean age = 71.4 ± 7.2). We conducted regression analyses predicting CDR at 36 months, controlling for demographics and genetic risk, with ADAS-Cog traditional scores and DCBs as predictors. RESULTS: The best predictor of CDR at 36 months was M, a DCB reflecting recall ability (area under the curve = 0.84), outperforming traditional scores. Diagnostic results suggest that M may be particularly useful to identify individuals who are unlikely to decline. DISCUSSION: These results suggest that M outperforms ADAS-Cog traditional metrics and supports process scoring for word-list recall tests. More research is needed to determine further applicability with other tests and populations. HIGHLIGHTS: Process scoring and latent modeling were more effective than traditional scoring. Latent recall ability (M) was the best predictor of Clinical Dementia Rating decline at 36 months. The top digital cognitive biomarker model had odds ≈ 90 times greater than the top Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive subscale model. Particularly high negative predictive value supports literature on cognitive testing as a useful screen. Consideration of both cognitive and pathological outcomes is needed.

Unveiling the link between glymphatic function and cortical microstructures in post-traumatic stress disorder.	PURPOSE: The discovery of the glymphatic system, crucial for cerebrospinal and interstitial fluid exchange, has enhanced our grasp of brain protein balance and its potential role in neurodegenerative disease prevention and therapy. Detecting early neurodegenerative shifts via noninvasive biomarkers could be key in identifying at-risk individuals for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Our research explores a diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) method that measures cortical mean diffusivity (cMD), potentially a more sensitive indicator of neurodegeneration than traditional macrostructural methods. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed 67 post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)-diagnosed veterans from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database. Participants underwent structural MRI, DTI, Aβ PET imaging, and cognitive testing. We focused on the DTI-ALPS technique to assess glymphatic function and its relation to cMD, cortical Aβ accumulation, and thickness, accounting for age and APOE ε4 allele variations. RESULTS: The cohort, all male with an average age of 68.1 (SD 3.4), showed a strong inverse correlation between DTI-ALPS and cMD in AD-affected regions, especially in the entorhinal, parahippocampal, and fusiform areas. Higher DTI-ALPS readings were consistently linked with greater cortical thickness, independent of Aβ deposits and genetic risk factors. Age and cMD emerged as inversely proportional predictors of DTI-ALPS, indicating a complex interaction with age. CONCLUSION: The study confirms a meaningful association between glymphatic efficiency and cMD in AD-sensitive zones, accentuating cortical microstructural alterations in PTSD. It positions DTI-ALPS as a viable biomarker for assessing glymphatic function in PTSD, implicating changes in DTI-ALPS as indicative of glymphatic impairment.

A Predictive Model of the Progression to Alzheimer's Disease in Patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment Based on the MRI Enlarged Perivascular Spaces.	BACKGROUND: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a heterogeneous condition that can precede various forms of dementia, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Identifying MCI subjects who are at high risk of progressing to AD is of major clinical relevance. Enlarged perivascular spaces (EPVS) on MRI are linked to cognitive decline, but their predictive value for MCI to AD progression is unclear. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to assess the predictive value of EPVS for MCI to AD progression and develop a predictive model combining EPVS grading with clinical and laboratory data to estimate conversion risk. METHODS: We analyzed 358 patients with MCI from the ADNI database, consisting of 177 MCI-AD converters and 181 non-converters. The data collected included demographic information, imaging data (including perivascular spaces grade), clinical assessments, and laboratory test results. Variable selection was conducted using the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) method, followed by logistic regression to develop predictive model. RESULTS: In the univariate logistic regression analysis, both moderate (OR = 5.54, 95% CI [3.04-10.18]) and severe (OR = 25.04, 95% CI [10.07-62.23]) enlargements of the centrum semiovale perivascular space (CSO-PVS) were found to be strong predictors of disease progression. LASSO analyses yielded 12 variables, refined to six in the final model: APOE4 genotype, ADAS11 score, CSO-PVS grade, and volumes of entorhinal, fusiform, and midtemporal regions, with an AUC of 0.956 in the training and 0.912 in the validation cohort. CONCLUSIONS: Our predictive model, emphasizing EPVS assessment, provides clinicians with a practical tool for early detection and management of AD risk in MCI patients.

PTSD moderates the association between subjective cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease biomarkers in older veterans.	OBJECTIVES: Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and subjective cognitive decline (SCD) are independent risk factors for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and dementia, but the association of their interaction on AD biomarkers have yet to be characterized. This study aimed to examine the impact of PTSD on the association between SCD and tau and amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) as well as global cognition in older Veterans. METHOD: This study included 87 Vietnam-Era Veterans without dementia (42 with PTSD; 45 without PTSD) from the Department of Defense-Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. All participants had both tau and amyloid PET imaging as well as cognitive testing. SCD was measured using the Everyday Cognition questionnaire. RESULTS: While SCD was associated with tau PET, amyloid PET, and global cognition, PTSD moderated these associations for tau and amyloid PET levels. Specifically, Veterans without PTSD had a stronger positive relationship between SCD and AD biomarkers when compared to those with PTSD. CONCLUSION: Higher SCD was associated with greater tau and amyloid burden and worse cognitive performance across the sample, though the tau and amyloid associations were stronger for Veterans without PTSD. Results highlight the potential benefit of comprehensive clinical assessments including consideration of mental health among older Veterans with SCD to understand the underlying cause of the cognitive concerns. Additionally, more work is needed to understand alternative mechanisms driving SCD in older Veterans with PTSD.	Alzheimer’s disease; PTSD; SCD; veterans

In Alzheimer's disease (AD) assessment, traditional deep learning approaches have often employed separate methodologies to handle the diverse modalities of input data. Recognizing the critical need for a cohesive and interconnected analytical framework, we propose the AD-Transformer, a novel transformer-based unified deep learning model. This innovative framework seamlessly integrates structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI), clinical, and genetic data from the extensive Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database, encompassing 1651 subjects. By employing a Patch-CNN block, the AD-Transformer efficiently transforms image data into image tokens, while a linear projection layer adeptly converts non-image data into corresponding tokens. As the core, a transformer block learns comprehensive representations of the input data, capturing the intricate interplay between modalities. The AD-Transformer sets a new benchmark in AD diagnosis and Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) conversion prediction, achieving remarkable average area under curve (AUC) values of 0.993 and 0.845, respectively, surpassing those of traditional image-only models and non-unified multimodal models. Our experimental results confirmed the potential of the AD-Transformer as a potent tool in AD diagnosis and MCI conversion prediction. By providing a unified framework that jointly learns holistic representations of both image and non-image data, the AD-Transformer paves the way for more effective and precise clinical assessments, offering a clinically adaptable strategy for leveraging diverse data modalities in the battle against AD.

Association of modified dementia risk score with cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers and cognition in adults without dementia.	INTRODUCTION: This study aimed to investigate the cognitive profile and prospective cognitive changes in non-demented adults with elevated Modified Dementia Risk Scores (MDRS), while also exploring the potential relationship between these associations and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology and neuroinflammation. METHODS: Within the Chinese Alzheimer's Biomarker and LifestylE (CABLE) database, 994 participants without dementia were assessed on MDRS, CSF biomarkers and cognition. We examined the associations of the MDRS with CSF biomarkers and cognitive scores using linear regressions. Causal mediation analyses were conducted to analyze the associations among MDRS, brain pathologies, and cognition. The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study was used to validate the mediation effects and to investigate the longitudinal association between MDRS and cognitive decline. RESULTS: The results revealed that higher MDRS were linked to poorer cognitive performance (Model 1: DISCUSSION: The findings of this study revealed significant associations between MDRS and cognitive decline, suggesting a potential role of tau pathology and neuroinflammation in the link between MDRS and poorer cognitive performance in individuals without dementia. Consequently, the MDRS holds promise as a tool for targeted preventive interventions in individuals at high risk of cognitive impairment.

MRI Signature of α-Synuclein Pathology in Asymptomatic Stages and a Memory Clinic Population.	IMPORTANCE: The lack of an in vivo measure for α-synuclein (α-syn) pathology until recently has limited thorough characterization of its brain atrophy pattern, especially during early disease stages. OBJECTIVE: To assess the association of state-of-the-art cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) seed amplification assays (SAA) α-syn positivity (SAA α-syn+) with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) structural measures, across the continuum from clinically unimpaired (CU) to cognitively impaired (CI) individuals, in 3 independent cohorts, and separately in CU and CI individuals, the latter reflecting a memory clinic population. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Cross-sectional data were used from the Swedish BioFINDER-2 study (inclusion, 2017-2023) as the discovery cohort and the Swedish BioFINDER-1 study (inclusion, 2007-2015) and Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI; inclusion 2005-2022) as replication cohorts. All cohorts are from multicenter studies, but the BioFINDER cohorts used 1 MRI scanner. CU and CI individuals fulfilling inclusion criteria and without missing data points in relevant metrics were included in the study. All analyses were performed from 2023 to 2024. EXPOSURES: Presence of α-syn pathology, estimated by baseline CSF SAA α-syn. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcomes were cross-sectional structural MRI measures either through voxel-based morphometry (VBM) or regions of interest (ROI) including an automated pipeline for cholinergic basal forebrain nuclei CH4/4p (nucleus basalis of Meynert [NBM]) and CH1/2/3. Secondary outcomes were domain-specific cross-sectional cognitive measures. Analyses were adjusted for CSF biomarkers of Alzheimer pathology. RESULTS: A total of 2961 participants were included in this study: 1388 (mean [SD] age, 71 [10] years; 702 female [51%]) from the BioFINDER-2 study, 752 (mean [SD] age, 72 [6] years; 406 female [54%]) from the BioFINDER-1 study, and 821 (mean [SD] age, 75 [8] years; 449 male [55%]) from ADNI. In the BioFINDER-2 study, VBM analyses in the whole cohort revealed a specific association between SAA α-syn+ and the cholinergic NBM, even when adjusting for Alzheimer copathology. ROI-based analyses in the BioFINDER-2 study focused on regions involved in the cholinergic system and confirmed that SAA α-syn+ was indeed independently associated with smaller NBM (β = -0.271; 95% CI, -0.399 to -0.142; P <.001) and CH1/2/3 volumes (β = -0.227; 95% CI, -0.377 to -0.076; P =.02). SAA α-syn+ was also independently associated with smaller NBM volumes in the separate CU (β = -0.360; 95% CI, -0.603 to -0.117; P =.03) and CI (β = -0.251; 95% CI, -0.408 to -0.095; P =.02) groups. Overall, the association between SAA α-syn+ and NBM volume was replicated in the BioFINDER-1 study and ADNI cohort. In CI individuals, NBM volumes partially mediated the association of SAA α-syn+ with attention/executive impairments in all cohorts (BioFINDER-2, β = -0.017; proportion-mediated effect, 7%; P =.04; BioFINDER-1, β = -0.096; proportion-mediated effect, 19%; P =.04; ADNI, β = -0.061; proportion-mediated effect, 20%; P =.007). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study, SAA α-syn+ was consistently associated with NBM atrophy already during asymptomatic stages. Further, in memory clinic CI populations, SAA α-syn+ was associated with NBM atrophy, which partially mediated α-syn-induced attention/executive impairment.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent cause of dementia, characterized by a steady decline in mental, behavioral, and social abilities and impairs a person's capacity for independent functioning. It is a fatal neurodegenerative disease primarily affecting older adults. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this literature review is to investigate various AD detection techniques, datasets, input modalities, algorithms, libraries, and performance evaluation metrics used to determine which model or strategy may provide superior performance. METHOD: The initial search yielded 807 papers, but only 100 research articles were chosen after applying the inclusion-exclusion criteria. This SLR analyzed research items published between January 2019 and December 2022. The ACM, Elsevier, IEEE Xplore Digital Library, PubMed, Springer and Taylor & Francis were systematically searched. The current study considers articles that used Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Positron Emission Tomography (PET), APOe4 genotype, Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) and Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) biomarkers. The study was performed following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. CONCLUSION: According to the literature survey, most studies (n = 76) used the DL strategy. The datasets used by studies were primarily derived from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. The majority of studies (n = 73) used single-modality neuroimaging data, while the remaining used multi-modal input data. In a multi-modality approach, the combination of MRI and PET scans is commonly preferred. Also, Regarding the algorithm used, Convolution Neural Network (CNN) showed the highest accuracy, 100 %, in classifying AD vs. CN subjects whereas the SVM was the most common ML algorithm, with a maximum accuracy of 99.82 %.

Associations between the choroid plexus and tau in Alzheimer's disease using an active learning segmentation pipeline.	BACKGROUND: The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), primarily generated by the choroid plexus (ChP), is the major carrier of the glymphatic system. The alternations of CSF production and the ChP can be associated with the Alzheimer's disease (AD). The present work investigated the roles of the ChP in the AD based on a proposed ChP image segmentation pipeline. METHODS: A human-in-the-loop ChP image segmentation pipeline was implemented with intermediate and active learning datasets. The performance of the proposed pipeline was evaluated on manual contours by five radiologists, compared to the FreeSurfer and FastSurfer toolboxes. The ChP volume and blood flow were investigated among AD groups. The correlations between the ChP volume and AD CSF biomarkers including phosphorylated tau (p-tau), total tau (t-tau), amyloid-β42 (Aβ42), and amyloid-β40 (Aβ40) was investigated using three models (univariate, multiple variables, and stepwise regression) on two datasets with 806 and 320 subjects. RESULTS: The proposed ChP segmentation pipeline achieved superior performance with a Dice coefficient of 0.620 on the test dataset, compared to the FreeSurfer (0.342) and FastSurfer (0.371). Significantly larger volumes (p < 0.001) and higher perfusion (p = 0.032) at the ChP were found in AD compared to CN groups. Significant correlations were found between the tau and the relative ChP volume (the ChP volume and ChP/parenchyma ratio) in each patient groups and in the univariate regression analysis (p < 0.001), the multiple regression model (p < 0.05 except for the t-tau in the LMCI), and in the step-wise regression model (p < 0.021). In addition, the correlation coefficients changed from - 0.32 to - 0.21 along with the AD progression in the multiple regression model. In contrast, the Aβ42 and Aβ40 shows consistent and significant associations with the lateral ventricle related measures in the step-wise regression model (p < 0.027). CONCLUSIONS: The proposed pipeline provided accurate ChP segmentation which revealed the associations between the ChP and tau level in the AD.

Analysis of Cerebrospinal Fluid, Plasma β-Amyloid Biomarkers, and Cognition from a 2-Year Phase 2 Trial Evaluating Oral ALZ-801/Valiltramiprosate in APOE4 Carriers with Early Alzheimer's Disease Using Quantitative Systems Pharmacology Model.	INTRODUCTION: ALZ-801/valiltramiprosate is an oral, small-molecule inhibitor of beta-amyloid (Aβ) aggregation and oligomer formation in late-stage development as a disease-modifying therapy for early Alzheimer's disease (AD). The present investigation provides a quantitative systems pharmacology (QSP) analysis of amyloid fluid biomarkers and cognitive results from a 2-year ALZ-801 Phase 2 trial in APOE4 carriers with early AD. METHODS: The single-arm, open-label phase 2 study evaluated effects of ALZ-801 265 mg two times daily (BID) on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma amyloid fluid biomarkers over 104 weeks in APOE4 carriers with early AD [Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) ≥ 22]. Subjects with positive CSF biomarkers for amyloid (Aβ RESULTS: A total of 84 subjects were enrolled. Excluding one subject who withdrew at the early stage of the trial, data from 83 subjects were used for this analysis. The ALZ-801 treatment arrested the progressive decline in CSF Aβ CONCLUSIONS: In this genetically defined and biomarker-enriched early AD population, the QSP analysis demonstrated a positive therapeutic effect of oral ALZ-801 265 mg BID by arresting the natural decline of monomeric CSF and plasma amyloid biomarkers, consistent with the target engagement to prevent their aggregation into soluble neurotoxic oligomers and subsequently into insoluble fibrils and plaques over 104 weeks. Accompanying the amyloid biomarker changes, ALZ-801 also stabilized the natural trajectory decline of the RAVLT memory test, suggesting that the clinical benefits are consistent with its mechanism of action. This sequential effect arresting the disease progression on biomarkers and cognitive decline was more pronounced in the earlier symptomatic stages of AD. The QSP analysis provides fluid biomarker and clinical evidence for ALZ-801 as a first-in-class, oral small-molecule anti-Aβ oligomer agent with disease modification potential in AD.

Continuous β-Amyloid CSF/PET Imbalance Model to Capture Alzheimer Disease Heterogeneity.	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Discordance between CSF and PET biomarkers of β-amyloid (Aβ) might reflect an imbalance between soluble and aggregated species, possibly reflecting disease heterogeneity. Previous studies generally used binary cutoffs to assess discrepancies in CSF/PET biomarkers, resulting in a loss of information on the extent of discordance. In this study, we (1) jointly modeled Aβ-CSF/PET data to derive a continuous measure of the imbalance between soluble and fibrillar pools of Aβ, (2) investigated factors contributing to this imbalance, and (3) examined associations with cognitive trajectories. METHODS: Across 822 cognitively unimpaired (n = 261) and cognitively impaired (n = 561) Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative individuals (384 [46.7%] females, mean age 73.0 ± 7.4 years), we fitted baseline CSF-Aβ RESULTS: The imbalance model could be fit (pseudo- DISCUSSION: We propose a novel continuous model of Aβ CSF/PET biomarker imbalance, accurately describing heterogeneity in soluble vs aggregated Aβ pools in 2 independent cohorts across the full Aβ continuum. Aβ-aggregation scores were consistently associated with genetic and AD-associated CSF biomarkers, possibly reflecting disease heterogeneity beyond methodological influences.

Towards cascading genetic risk in Alzheimer's disease.	Alzheimer's disease typically progresses in stages, which have been defined by the presence of disease-specific biomarkers: amyloid (A), tau (T) and neurodegeneration (N). This progression of biomarkers has been condensed into the ATN framework, in which each of the biomarkers can be either positive (+) or negative (-). Over the past decades, genome-wide association studies have implicated ∼90 different loci involved with the development of late-onset Alzheimer's disease. Here, we investigate whether genetic risk for Alzheimer's disease contributes equally to the progression in different disease stages or whether it exhibits a stage-dependent effect. Amyloid (A) and tau (T) status was defined using a combination of available PET and CSF biomarkers in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative cohort. In 312 participants with biomarker-confirmed A-T- status, we used Cox proportional hazards models to estimate the contribution of APOE and polygenic risk scores (beyond APOE) to convert to A+T- status (65 conversions). Furthermore, we repeated the analysis in 290 participants with A+T- status and investigated the genetic contribution to conversion to A+T+ (45 conversions). Both survival analyses were adjusted for age, sex and years of education. For progression from A-T- to A+T-, APOE-e4 burden showed a significant effect [hazard ratio (HR) = 2.88; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.70-4.89; P < 0.001], whereas polygenic risk did not (HR = 1.09; 95% CI: 0.84-1.42; P = 0.53). Conversely, for the transition from A+T- to A+T+, the contribution of APOE-e4 burden was reduced (HR = 1.62; 95% CI: 1.05-2.51; P = 0.031), whereas the polygenic risk showed an increased contribution (HR = 1.73; 95% CI: 1.27-2.36; P < 0.001). The marginal APOE effect was driven by e4 homozygotes (HR = 2.58; 95% CI: 1.05-6.35; P = 0.039) as opposed to e4 heterozygotes (HR = 1.74; 95% CI: 0.87-3.49; P = 0.12). The genetic risk for late-onset Alzheimer's disease unfolds in a disease stage-dependent fashion. A better understanding of the interplay between disease stage and genetic risk can lead to a more mechanistic understanding of the transition between ATN stages and a better understanding of the molecular processes leading to Alzheimer's disease, in addition to opening therapeutic windows for targeted interventions.

Variants in the MS4A cluster interact with soluble TREM2 expression on biomarkers of neuropathology.	Recent evidence suggests that Alzheimer's disease (AD) genetic risk variants (rs1582763 and rs6591561) of the MS4A locus are genome-wide significant regulators of soluble TREM2 levels such that the minor allele of the protective variant (rs1582763) is associated with higher sTREM2 and lower AD risk while the minor allele of (rs6591561) relates to lower sTREM2 and higher AD risk.

Cognitive Trajectories and Alzheimer Disease Biomarkers: From Successful Cognitive Aging to Clinical Impairment.	OBJECTIVE: Cross-sectional definitions of successful cognitive aging have been widely utilized, but longitudinal measurements can identify people who do not decline. We performed this study to contrast maintenance with declining trajectories, including clinical conversion. METHODS: We included baseline cognitively unimpaired Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative participants with 3 or more cognitive testing sessions (n = 539, follow-up 6.1 ± 3.5 years) and calculated slopes of an episodic memory composite (MEM) to classify them into two groups: maintainers (slope ≥ 0) and decliners (slope < 0). Within decliners, we examined a subgroup of individuals who became clinically impaired during follow-up. These groups were compared on baseline characteristics and cognitive performance, as well as both cross-sectional and longitudinal Alzheimer disease (AD) biomarker measures (beta-amyloid [Aβ], tau, and hippocampal volume). RESULTS: Forty-one percent (n = 221) of the cohort were MEM maintainers, and 33% (n = 105) of decliners converted to clinical impairment during follow-up. Compared to those with superior baseline scores, maintainers had lower education and were more likely to be male. Maintainers and decliners did not differ on baseline MEM scores, but maintainers did have higher non-MEM cognitive scores. Maintainers had lower baseline global Aβ, lower tau pathology, and larger hippocampal volumes than decliners, even after removing converters. There were no differences in rates of change of any AD biomarkers between any cognitive trajectory groups except for a higher rate of hippocampal atrophy in clinical converters compared to maintainers. INTERPRETATION: Using longitudinal data to define cognitive trajectory groups reduces education and sex bias and reveals the prognostic importance of early onset of accumulation of AD pathology.

Cerebrospinal fluid α-synuclein adds the risk of cognitive decline and is associated with tau pathology among non-demented older adults.	BACKGROUND: The role of α-synuclein in dementia has been recognized, yet its exact influence on cognitive decline in non-demented older adults is still not fully understood. METHODS: A total of 331 non-demented individuals were included in the study from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Participants were divided into two distinct groups based on their α-synuclein levels: one with lower levels (α-synuclein-L) and another with higher levels (α-synuclein-H). Measurements included neuropsychiatric scales, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, and blood transcriptomics. The linear mixed-effects model investigated the longitudinal changes in cognition. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and the Cox proportional hazards model were utilized to evaluate the effects of different levels of α-synuclein on dementia. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was utilized to investigate the biological pathways related to cognitive impairment. Pearson correlation, multiple linear regression models, and mediation analysis were employed to investigate the relationship between α-synuclein and neurodegenerative biomarkers, and their potential mechanisms affecting cognition. RESULTS: Higher CSF α-synuclein levels were associated with increased risk of cognitive decline and progression to dementia. Enrichment analysis highlighted the activation of tau-associated and immune response pathways in the α-synuclein-H group. Further correlation and regression analysis indicated that the CSF α-synuclein levels were positively correlated with CSF total tau (t-tau), phosphorylated tau (p-tau) 181, tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR1) and intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1). Mediation analysis further elucidated that the detrimental effects of CSF α-synuclein on cognition were primarily mediated through CSF t-tau and p-tau. Additionally, it was observed that CSF α-synuclein influenced CSF t-tau and p-tau181 levels via inflammatory pathways involving CSF TNFR1 and ICAM-1. CONCLUSIONS: These findings elucidate a significant connection between elevated levels of CSF α-synuclein and the progression of cognitive decline, highlighting the critical roles of activated inflammatory pathways and tau pathology in this association. They underscore the importance of monitoring CSF α-synuclein levels as a promising biomarker for identifying individuals at increased risk of cognitive deterioration and developing dementia.

Impact of serum leptin and adiponectin levels on brain infarcts in patients with mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease: a longitudinal analysis.	INTRODUCTION: The adipokines leptin and adiponectin have been associated with atherosclerosis and the risk of cerebral infarcts. Pre-clinical studies, however, suggest a protective role against ischemic brain damage. In this study we analyzed the relationship between serum leptin and adiponectin levels and the onset or progression of brain infarcts in subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHODS: All data were extracted from the ADNI database. The final population included 566 subjects, with 58 healthy controls, 396 MCI and 112 AD. All patients with available serum leptin and adiponectin levels at baseline were selected. Demographics, neuropsychological test results, CSF biomarkers, regional brain metabolism with FDG-PET data and the number of brain infarcts on longitudinal MRI scans were extracted. RESULTS: Leptin levels were significantly lower in patients with MCI than controls at baseline, while adiponectin levels were not different between the groups. Multivariate logistic regression analysis at baseline for the presence of brain infarcts showed a predictive value for leptin but not for adiponectin. Multivariate longitudinal analysis showed that age was the only significant predictor of brain infarcts development at 15-year follow-up, while serum leptin and adiponectin levels did not play a role in this population. DISCUSSION: The evidence on the pathogenetic or protective role of adipokines on ischemic brain damage is mixed. In this MCI and AD population, serum leptin and adiponectin were not associated with the development of brain infarcts; therefore, these results do not support the use of adipokines as biomarkers of cerebrovascular pathology in this population.

Identifying Progression-Specific Alzheimer's Subtypes Using Multimodal Transformer.	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disease, yet its current treatments are limited to stopping disease progression. Moreover, the effectiveness of these treatments remains uncertain due to the heterogeneity of the disease. Therefore, it is essential to identify disease subtypes at a very early stage. Current data-driven approaches can be used to classify subtypes during later stages of AD or related disorders, but making predictions in the asymptomatic or prodromal stage is challenging. Furthermore, the classifications of most existing models lack explainability, and these models rely solely on a single modality for assessment, limiting the scope of their analysis. Thus, we propose a multimodal framework that utilizes early-stage indicators, including imaging, genetics, and clinical assessments, to classify AD patients into progression-specific subtypes at an early stage. In our framework, we introduce a tri-modal co-attention mechanism (Tri-COAT) to explicitly capture cross-modal feature associations. Data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) (slow progressing = 177, intermediate = 302, and fast = 15) were used to train and evaluate Tri-COAT using a 10-fold stratified cross-testing approach. Our proposed model outperforms baseline models and sheds light on essential associations across multimodal features supported by known biological mechanisms. The multimodal design behind Tri-COAT allows it to achieve the highest classification area under the receiver operating characteristic curve while simultaneously providing interpretability to the model predictions through the co-attention mechanism.

Pathophysiology characterization of Alzheimer's disease in South China's aging population: for the Greater-Bay-Area Healthy Aging Brain Study (GHABS).	INTRODUCTION: The Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater-Bay-Area of South China has an 86 million population and faces a significant challenge of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the characteristics and prevalence of AD in this area are still unclear due to the rarely available community-based neuroimaging AD cohort. METHODS: Following the standard protocols of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, the Greater-Bay-Area Healthy Aging Brain Study (GHABS) was initiated in 2021. GHABS participants completed clinical assessments, plasma biomarkers, genotyping, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), β-amyloid (Aβ) positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, and tau PET imaging. The GHABS cohort focuses on pathophysiology characterization and early AD detection in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area. In this study, we analyzed plasma Aβ RESULTS: The aims, study design, data collection, and potential applications of GHABS are summarized. SCD individuals had significantly higher plasma p-Tau DISCUSSION: The GHABS cohort may provide helpful guidance toward designing standard AD community cohorts in South China. This study, for the first time, reported the pathophysiology characterization of plasma biomarkers, Aβ PET, tau PET, hippocampal atrophy, and AD-signature cortical thinning, as well as the prevalence of Aβ PET positivity in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area of China. These findings provide novel insights into understanding the characteristics of abnormal AD pathological changes in South China's older population.

Cerebrospinal fluid amyloid-β and cerebral microbleed are associated with distinct neuropsychiatric sub-syndromes in cognitively impaired patients.	BACKGROUND: Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) are prevalent in cognitively impaired individuals including Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Whereas several studies have reported the associations between NPS with AD pathologic biomarkers and cerebral small vessel disease (SVD), but it remains unknown whether AD pathology and SVD contribute to different sub-syndromes independently or aggravate same symptoms synergistically. METHOD: We included 445 cognitively impaired individuals (including 316 MCI and 129 AD) with neuropsychiatric, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers (Aβ42, p-tau, and t-tau) and multi-model MRI data. Psychiatric symptoms were accessed by using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI). Visual assessment of SVD (white matter hyperintensity, microbleed, perivascular space, lacune) on MRI images was performed by experienced radiologist. Linear regression analyses were conducted to test the association between neuropsychiatric symptoms with AD pathology and CSVD burden after adjustment for age, sex, education, apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 carrier status, and clinical diagnosis. RESULTS: The NPI total scores were related to microbleed (estimate 2.424; 95% CI [0.749, 4.099]; P =0.005). Considering the sub-syndromes, the hyperactivity was associated with microbleed (estimate 0.925; 95% CI [0.115, 1.735]; P =0.025), whereas the affective symptoms were correlated to CSF level of Aβ CONCLUSION: Our study showed that CSF Aβ	Alzheimer’s disease; Amyloid; Biomarkers; Neuropsychiatry; Small vessel disease

Blood biomarkers in dynamic prediction of conversion to Alzheimer's disease: An application of joint modeling.	OBJECTIVES: To investigate the accuracy of longitudinal trajectories of blood biomarkers for predicting future onset of AD among MCI participants as well as to demonstrate dynamic prediction of the individual conversion risk applying joint modeling. METHODS: A total of 446 participants with MCI at baseline from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database were included. We introduced joint modeling to analyze the effects of the longitudinal blood biomarkers on the conversion risk to AD, and further to build individual-specific prediction risk model. RESULTS: During the follow-up, 345 participants remained with MCI and 101 progressed to AD, and were categorized as non-progression and progression group, respectively. Longitudinally, the positive association of the concentration dynamics of plasma p-tau181 and NfL with the conversion risk to AD from MCI was also demonstrated, with Hazard Ratio (HR) = 5.83 and HR = 4.18, respectively. When incorporating plasma p-tau181 and NfL together to predict AD progression, we observed improved performance (AUC = 0.701, Brier Score = 0.119). Two participants were chosen to exemplify the individual-specific risk prediction at different follow-up time for comparative analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Plasma p-tau181 and NfL could serve as biomarkers for the prediction of AD onset, and the individualized prediction opens up the possibility to provide clinical information at a personal level.

Longitudinal Relationship Between Brain Atrophy Patterns, Cognitive Decline, and Cerebrospinal Fluid Biomarkers in Alzheimer's Disease Explored by Orthonormal Projective Non-Negative Matrix Factorization.	BACKGROUND: Longitudinal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been proposed for tracking the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) through the assessment of brain atrophy. OBJECTIVE: Detection of brain atrophy patterns in patients with AD as the longitudinal disease tracker. METHODS: We used a refined version of orthonormal projective non-negative matrix factorization (OPNMF) to identify six distinct spatial components of voxel-wise volume loss in the brains of 83 subjects with AD from the ADNI3 cohort relative to healthy young controls from the ABIDE study. We extracted non-negative coefficients representing subject-specific quantitative measures of regional atrophy. Coefficients of brain atrophy were compared to subjects with mild cognitive impairment and controls, to investigate the cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between AD biomarkers and regional atrophy severity in different groups. We further validated our results in an independent dataset from ADNI2. RESULTS: The six non-overlapping atrophy components represent symmetric gray matter volume loss primarily in frontal, temporal, parietal and cerebellar regions. Atrophy in these regions was highly correlated with cognition both cross-sectionally and longitudinally, with medial temporal atrophy showing the strongest correlations. Subjects with elevated CSF levels of TAU and PTAU and lower baseline CSF Aβ42 values, demonstrated a tendency toward a more rapid increase of atrophy. CONCLUSIONS: The present study has applied a transferable method to characterize the imaging changes associated with AD through six spatially distinct atrophy components and correlated these atrophy patterns with cognitive changes and CSF biomarkers cross-sectionally and longitudinally, which may help us better understand the underlying pathology of AD.

Predicting early Alzheimer's with blood biomarkers and clinical features.	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an incurable neurodegenerative disorder that leads to dementia. This study employs explainable machine learning models to detect dementia cases using blood gene expression, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and clinical data from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Analyzing 623 ADNI participants, we found that the Support Vector Machine classifier with Mutual Information (MI) feature selection, trained on all three data modalities, achieved exceptional performance (accuracy = 0.95, AUC = 0.94). When using gene expression and SNP data separately, we achieved very good performance (AUC = 0.65, AUC = 0.63, respectively). Using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), we identified significant features, potentially serving as AD biomarkers. Notably, genetic-based biomarkers linked to axon myelination and synaptic vesicle membrane formation could aid early AD detection. In summary, this genetic-based biomarker approach, integrating machine learning and SHAP, shows promise for precise AD diagnosis, biomarker discovery, and offers novel insights for understanding and treating the disease. This approach addresses the challenges of accurate AD diagnosis, which is crucial given the complexities associated with the disease and the need for non-invasive diagnostic methods.

Predicting long-term progression of Alzheimer's disease using a multimodal deep learning model incorporating interaction effects.	BACKGROUND: Identifying individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) at risk of progressing to Alzheimer's disease (AD) provides a unique opportunity for early interventions. Therefore, accurate and long-term prediction of the conversion from MCI to AD is desired but, to date, remains challenging. Here, we developed an interpretable deep learning model featuring a novel design that incorporates interaction effects and multimodality to improve the prediction accuracy and horizon for MCI-to-AD progression. METHODS: This multi-center, multi-cohort retrospective study collected structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI), clinical assessments, and genetic polymorphism data of 252 patients with MCI at baseline from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Our deep learning model was cross-validated on the ADNI-1 and ADNI-2/GO cohorts and further generalized in the ongoing ADNI-3 cohort. We evaluated the model performance using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and F1 score. RESULTS: On the cross-validation set, our model achieved superior results for predicting MCI conversion within 4 years (AUC, 0.962; accuracy, 92.92%; sensitivity, 88.89%; specificity, 95.33%) compared to all existing studies. In the independent test, our model exhibited consistent performance with an AUC of 0.939 and an accuracy of 92.86%. Integrating interaction effects and multimodal data into the model significantly increased prediction accuracy by 4.76% (P = 0.01) and 4.29% (P = 0.03), respectively. Furthermore, our model demonstrated robustness to inter-center and inter-scanner variability, while generating interpretable predictions by quantifying the contribution of multimodal biomarkers. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed deep learning model presents a novel perspective by combining interaction effects and multimodality, leading to more accurate and longer-term predictions of AD progression, which promises to improve pre-dementia patient care.

Interaction between Aβ and tau on reversion and conversion in mild cognitive impairment patients: After 2-year follow-up.	BACKGROUND: The role of amyloid-β (Aβ) and tau in reversion and conversion in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the influence of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Aβ and tau on reversion and conversion and the temporal sequence of their pathogenicity in MCI patients. METHODS: 179 MCI patients were recruited from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database and classified into two groups based on cognitive changes after follow-up: reversal group (MCI to cognitively normal) and conversion group (MCI to Alzheimer's disease). CSF biomarkers and cognitive function were measured at baseline and 2-year follow-up. Partial correlation was used to analyze the association between CSF biomarkers and cognitive function, and multivariable logistic regression to identify independent risk factors for cognitive changes at baseline and 2-year follow-up. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were utilized to evaluate the predictive ability of these risk factors for cognitive changes. RESULTS: The differences in cognitive function and CSF biomarkers between the two groups remained consistent with baseline after 2-year follow-up. After controlling for confounding variables, there was still a correlation between CSF biomarkers and cognitive function at baseline and 2-year follow-up. Multivariable regression analysis found that at baseline, only Aβ level was independently associated with cognitive changes, while Aβ and tau were both predictive factors after 2-year follow-up. ROC curve analysis revealed that the combination of Aβ and tau [area under the curve (AUC) 0.91, sensitivity 84%, specificity 86%] in predicting cognitive changes after 2-year follow-up had better efficacy than baseline Aβ alone (AUC 0.81). CONCLUSION: Aβ may precede Tau in causing cognitive changes, and the interaction between the two mediates cognitive changes in patients. This study provides new clinical evidence to support the view that Aβ pathology precedes tau pathology, which together contribute to the changes in cognitive function.

Bile acid profile associated with CSF and PET biomarkers in Alzheimer's disease.	BACKGROUND: Recent studies have shown that gut microbiota can affect the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD) through various mechanisms. Bile acids (BAs), which are the final byproducts of cholesterol metabolism created through both the human body and gut microbiome, appear to be influenced by gut microbiota and may impact AD pathological characteristics such as the accumulation of tau and amyloid-β. We aimed to investigate the associations between various serum BAs and CSF biomarkers (including Aβ, total tau, and p-tau). Additionally, we sought to examine the longitudinal changes in brain Aβ and tau through PET imaging in relation to BAs profile. METHODS: The data of 828 subjects including 491 diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), 119 patients diagnosed with AD, and 267 cognitively normal (CN) participants were obtained from ADNI. The baseline and longitudinal [ RESULTS: After FDR correction we observed that five BAs level and relevant calculated ratios were associated with CSF p-tau and tau, three with CSF Aβ1-42. Furthermore, three BAs level and relevant calculated ratios were associated with the tau-PET rate of change, and two with the Aβ rate of change. CONCLUSION: The findings from our study suggest a correlation between altered profiles of BAs and CSF and imaging biomarkers associated with AD. These results provide supporting evidence for the link between the gut microbiome and the pathological features of AD.	Alzheimer’s disease; Amyloid βeta; Bile acid; Gut-brain axis; Metabolomics; Tau

Personalized Computational Causal Modeling of the Alzheimer Disease Biomarker Cascade.	BACKGROUND: Mathematical models of complex diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, have the potential to play a significant role in personalized medicine. Specifically, models can be personalized by fitting parameters with individual data for the purpose of discovering primary underlying disease drivers, predicting natural history, and assessing the effects of theoretical interventions. Previous work in causal/mechanistic modeling of Alzheimer's Disease progression has modeled the disease at the cellular level and on a short time scale, such as minutes to hours. No previous studies have addressed mechanistic modeling on a personalized level using clinically validated biomarkers in individual subjects. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to investigate the feasibility of personalizing a causal model of Alzheimer's Disease progression using longitudinal biomarker data. DESIGN/SETTING/PARTICIPANTS/MEASUREMENTS: We chose the Alzheimer Disease Biomarker Cascade model, a widely-referenced hypothetical model of Alzheimer's Disease based on the amyloid cascade hypothesis, which we had previously implemented mathematically as a mechanistic model. We used available longitudinal demographic and serial biomarker data in over 800 subjects across the cognitive spectrum from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. The data included participants that were cognitively normal, had mild cognitive impairment, or were diagnosed with dementia (probable Alzheimer's Disease). The model consisted of a sparse system of differential equations involving four measurable biomarkers based on cerebrospinal fluid proteins, imaging, and cognitive testing data. RESULTS: Personalization of the Alzheimer Disease Biomarker Cascade model with individual serial biomarker data yielded fourteen personalized parameters in each subject reflecting physiologically meaningful characteristics. These included growth rates, latency values, and carrying capacities of the various biomarkers, most of which demonstrated significant differences across clinical diagnostic groups. The model fits to training data across the entire cohort had a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.09 (SD 0.081) on a variable scale between zero and one, and were robust, with over 90% of subjects showing an RMSE of < 0.2. Similarly, in a subset of subjects with data on all four biomarkers in at least one test set, performance was high on the test sets, with a mean RMSE of 0.15 (SD 0.117), with 80% of subjects demonstrating an RMSE < 0.2 in the estimation of future biomarker points. Cluster analysis of parameters revealed two distinct endophenotypic groups, with distinct biomarker profiles and disease trajectories. CONCLUSION: Results support the feasibility of personalizing mechanistic models based on individual biomarker trajectories and suggest that this approach may be useful for reclassifying subjects on the Alzheimer's clinical spectrum. This computational modeling approach is not limited to the Alzheimer Disease Biomarker Cascade hypothesis, and can be applied to any mechanistic hypothesis of disease progression in the Alzheimer's field that can be monitored with biomarkers. Thus, it offers a computational platform to compare and validate various disease hypotheses, personalize individual biomarker trajectories and predict individual response to theoretical prevention and therapeutic intervention strategies.

Microglial Reactivity Correlates with Presynaptic Loss Independent of β-Amyloid and Tau.	OBJECTIVE: Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-2 (TREM2) and progranulin (PGRN) are critical regulators of microglia activation and can be detected in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). However, whether microglial reactivity is detrimental or neuroprotective for Alzheimer disease (AD) is still debatable. METHODS: We identified 663 participants with baseline β-amyloid (Aβ) positron emission tomography (PET) and CSF biomarker data, including phosphorylated tau181 (p-Tau RESULTS: Higher baseline levels of CSF microglial biomarkers were related to faster rates of CSF sTREM2 increase and CSF PGRN decrease. Elevated CSF p-Tau INTERPRETATION: These findings suggest that higher Aβ burden may attenuate the p-Tau-associated microglial responses, and TREM2-related microglial reactivity may independently correlate with GAP-43-related presynaptic loss. This study highlights the two-edged role of microglial reactivity in AD and other neurodegenerative diseases. ANN NEUROL 2024;95:917-928.

Comparing neuropsychological, typical, and ADNI criteria for the diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment in Vietnam-era veterans.	OBJECTIVE: Neuropsychological criteria for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) more accurately predict progression to Alzheimer's disease (AD) and are more strongly associated with AD biomarkers and neuroimaging profiles than ADNI criteria. However, research to date has been conducted in relatively healthy samples with few comorbidities. Given that history of traumatic brain injury (TBI) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are risk factors for AD and common in Veterans, we compared neuropsychological, typical (Petersen/Winblad), and ADNI criteria for MCI in Vietnam-era Veterans with histories of TBI or PTSD. METHOD: 267 Veterans (mean age = 69.8) from the DOD-ADNI study were evaluated for MCI using neuropsychological, typical, and ADNI criteria. Linear regressions adjusting for age and education assessed associations between MCI status and AD biomarker levels (cerebrospinal fluid [CSF] RESULTS: Agreement between criteria was poor. Neuropsychological criteria identified more Veterans with MCI than typical or ADNI criteria, and were associated with higher CSF CONCLUSIONS: MCI diagnosis using sensitive neuropsychological criteria is more strongly associated with AD biomarkers than conventional diagnostic methods. MCI diagnostics in Veterans would benefit from incorporation of comprehensive neuropsychological methods and consideration of the impact of PTSD.

Differential Associations of APOEɛ2 and APOEɛ4 Genotypes with Cerebrospinal Fluid Biomarkers of Alzheimer's Disease in Individuals Without Dementia.	BACKGROUND: The APOE genotype has emerged as the major genetic factor for AD but differs among different alleles. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the discrepant effects of APOE genotype on AD cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers. METHODS: A total of 989 non-demented ADNI participants were included. The associations of APOEɛ2 and APOEɛ4 with CSF biomarkers were investigated using linear regression models. Interaction and subgroup analyses were used to investigate the effects of sex and age on these associations. Furthermore, we used mediation analyses to assess whether Aβ mediated the associations between APOE genotypes and tau. RESULTS: APOEɛ2 carriers only showed higher Aβ levels (β [95% CI] = 0.07 [0.01, 0.13], p = 0.026). Conversely, APOEɛ4 carriers exhibited lower Aβ concentration (β [95% CI] = -0.27 [-0.31, -0.24], p < 0.001), higher t-Tau (β [95% CI] = 0.25 [0.08, 0.18], p < 0.001) and higher p-Tau (β [95% CI] = 0.31 [0.25, 0.37], p < 0.001). Subgroup analysis showed that APOE ɛ2 was significantly positively associated with Aβ only in females (β [95% CI] = 0.12 [0.04, 0.21], p = 0.005) and older people (β [95% CI] = 0.06 [0.001, 0.12], p = 0.048). But the effects of APOE ɛ4 were independent of gender and age. Besides, the associations of APOE ɛ4 with t-Tau and p-Tau were both mediated by baseline Aβ. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggested that APOEɛ2 could promote Aβ clearance, while the process could be modified by sex and age. However, APOEɛ4 might cause the accumulation of Aβ and tau pathology independent of sex and age.	APOE; Age interaction; Alzheimer’s disease; amyloid-β; sex interaction; tau

CSF 14-3-3β is associated with progressive cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease.	Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized pathologically by amyloid-beta plaques, tau tangles and neuronal loss. In clinical practice, the 14-3-3 isoform beta (β) is a biomarker that aids in the diagnosis of sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Recently, a proteomics study found increased CSF 14-3-3β levels in Alzheimer's disease patients, suggesting a potential link between CSF 14-3-3β and Alzheimer's disease. Our present study aimed to further investigate the role of CSF 14-3-3β in Alzheimer's disease by analysing the data of 719 participants with available CSF 14-3-3β measurements from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. Higher CSF 14-3-3β levels were observed in the mild cognitive impairment group compared to the cognitively normal group, with the highest CSF 14-3-3β levels in the Alzheimer's disease dementia group. This study also found significant associations between CSF 14-3-3β levels and CSF biomarkers of p-tau, t-tau, pTau/Aβ42 ratios and GAP-43, as well as other Alzheimer's disease biomarkers such as Aβ-PET. An early increase in CSF 14-3-3β levels was observed prior to Aβ-PET-positive status, and CSF 14-3-3β levels continued to rise after crossing the Aβ-PET positivity threshold before reaching a plateau. The diagnostic accuracy of CSF 14-3-3β (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.819) was moderate compared to other established Alzheimer's disease biomarkers in distinguishing cognitively normal Aβ pathology-negative individuals from Alzheimer's disease Aβ pathology-positive individuals. Higher baseline CSF 14-3-3β levels were associated with accelerated cognitive decline, reduced hippocampus volumes and declining fluorodeoxyglucose-PET values over a 4-year follow-up period. Patients with mild cognitive impairment and high CSF 14-3-3β levels at baseline had a significantly increased risk [hazard ratio = 2.894 (1.599-5.238),	14-3-3β; Alzheimer’s disease; CSF; biomarker; dementia

APOE4 allele-specific associations between diet, multimodal biomarkers, and cognition among Puerto Rican adults in Massachusetts.	BACKGROUND: Apolipoprotein E (APOE) is the strongest genetic risk factor for sporadic Alzheimer's Disease (AD), and the ε4 allele (APOE4) may interact with lifestyle factors that relate to brain structural changes, underlying the increased risk of AD. However, the exact role of APOE4 in mediating interactions between the peripheral circulatory system and the central nervous system, and how it may link to brain and cognitive aging requires further elucidation. In this analysis, we investigated the association between APOE4 carrier status and multimodal biomarkers (diet, blood markers, clinical diagnosis, brain structure, and cognition) in the context of gene-environment interactions. METHODS: Participants were older adults from a longitudinal observational study, the Boston Puerto Rican Health Study (BPRHS), who self-identified as of Puerto Rican descent. Demographics, APOE genotype, diet, blood, and clinical data were collected at baseline and at approximately 12th year, with the addition of multimodal brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (T1-weighted and diffusion) and cognitive testing acquired at 12-year. Measures were compared between APOE4 carriers and non-carriers, and associations between multimodal variables were examined using correlation and multivariate network analyses within each group. RESULTS: A total of 156 BPRHS participants (mean age at imaging = 68 years, 77% female, mean follow-up 12.7 years) with complete multimodal data were included in the current analysis. APOE4 carriers ( CONCLUSION: APOE4 carrier status affects interactions between dietary factors, multimodal blood biomarkers, and MTL WM integrity across ~12 years of follow-up, which may reflect increased peripheral-central systems crosstalk following blood-brain barrier breakdown in carriers.

Neuropsychiatric Symptoms and In Vivo Alzheimer's Biomarkers in Mild Cognitive Impairment.	BACKGROUND: Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) carry an increased risk of progression from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to Alzheimer's disease (AD). There is a need to understand how to integrate NPS into the paradigm outlined in the 2018 NIA-AA Research Framework. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate a prediction model of MCI-AD progression using a collection of variables, including NPS, cognitive testing, apolipoprotein E4 status (APOE4), imaging and laboratory AD biomarkers. METHODS: Of 300 elderly subjects, 219 had stable MCI and 81 MCI-AD progression over a 5-year follow-up. NPS were measured using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI). A multivariate Cox Proportional Hazards Regression Analysis assessed the effects of APOE4, baseline NPI, baseline CSF amyloid-β, phosphorylated and total tau, baseline AD-signature MRI biomarker, baseline memory and executive function on MCI-AD progression. RESULTS: 27% progressed to dementia (median follow-up = 43 months). NPS were found in stable MCI (62.6%) and MCI-AD converters (70.3%). The Cox model exhibited a good fit (p < 0.001), and NPS (HR = 1.033, p = 0.027), phosphorylated tau (HR = 1.011, p = 0.025), total tau (HR = 1.005, p = 0.024), AD-signature MRI biomarker (HR = 0.111, p = 0.002), executive function (HR = 0.727, p = 0.045), and memory performance (HR = 0.387, p < 0.001) were significantly associated with dementia. CONCLUSIONS: NPS may inform dementia risk assessment in conjunction with cognitive testing and imaging and laboratory AD biomarkers. NPS is independently associated with the risk of MCI-dementia progression, over and beyond the contributions of CSF biomarkers.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by memory and functional impairments. Two of 3 patients with AD are biologically female; therefore, the biological underpinnings of this diagnosis disparity may inform interventions slowing the AD progression. To bridge this gap, we conducted analyses of 1078 male and female participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative to examine associations between levels of cerebral spinal fluid (CSF)/neuroimaging biomarkers and cognitive/functional outcomes. The Chow test was used to quantify sex differences by determining if biological sex affects relationships between the studied biomarkers and outcomes. Multiple magnetic resonance imaging (whole brain, entorhinal cortex, middle temporal gyrus, fusiform gyrus, hippocampus), position emission tomography (AV45), and CSF (P-TAU, TAU) biomarkers were differentially associated with cognitive and functional outcomes. Post-hoc bootstrapped and association analyses confirmed these differential effects and emphasized the necessity of using separate, sex-stratified models. The studied imaging/CSF biomarkers may account for some of the sex-based variation in AD pathophysiology. The identified sex-varying relationships between CSF/imaging biomarkers and cognitive/functional outcomes warrant future biological investigation in independent cohorts.

Should ITSN1 be considered as a Mendelian Parkinson's disease gene? Description of three novel families.	Rare loss-of-function variants in ITSN1 were recently reported to confer a high risk for Parkinson's disease (PD). From our local large exome sequencing dataset of PD cases, we identified five carriers from three families. Clinical features of ITSN1-PD are typical and responsive to standard treatments. Additionally, we discuss whether ITSN1 loss-of-function variants should only be considered as a high-risk factor or a Mendelian PD gene.

Parkinson's families project: a UK-wide study of early onset and familial Parkinson's disease.	The Parkinson's Families Project is a UK-wide study aimed at identifying genetic variation associated with familial and early-onset Parkinson's disease (PD). We recruited individuals with a clinical diagnosis of PD and age at motor symptom onset ≤45 years and/or a family history of PD in up to third-degree relatives. Where possible, we also recruited affected and unaffected relatives. We analysed DNA samples with a combination of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array genotyping, multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA), and whole-genome sequencing (WGS). We investigated the association between identified pathogenic mutations and demographic and clinical factors such as age at motor symptom onset, family history, motor symptoms (MDS-UPDRS) and cognitive performance (MoCA). We performed baseline genetic analysis in 718 families, of which 205 had sporadic early-onset PD (sEOPD), 113 had familial early-onset PD (fEOPD), and 400 had late-onset familial PD (fLOPD). 69 (9.6%) of these families carried pathogenic variants in known monogenic PD-related genes. The rate of a molecular diagnosis increased to 28.1% in PD with motor onset ≤35 years. We identified pathogenic variants in LRRK2 in 4.2% of families, and biallelic pathogenic variants in PRKN in 3.6% of families. We also identified two families with SNCA duplications and three families with a pathogenic repeat expansion in ATXN2, as well as single families with pathogenic variants in VCP, PINK1, PNPLA6, PLA2G6, SPG7, GCH1, and RAB32. An additional 73 (10.2%) families were carriers of at least one pathogenic or risk GBA1 variant. Most early-onset and familial PD cases do not have a known genetic cause, indicating that there are likely to be further monogenic causes for PD.

BACKGROUND: Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder with multifactorial causes, among which genetic risk factors play a part. The RAB GTPases are regulators and substrates of LRRK2, and variants in the LRRK2 gene are important risk factors for Parkinson's disease. We aimed to explore genetic variability in RAB GTPases within cases of familial Parkinson's disease. METHODS: We did whole-exome sequencing in probands from families in Canada and Tunisia with Parkinson's disease without a genetic cause, who were recruited from the Centre for Applied Neurogenetics (Vancouver, BC, Canada), an international consortium that includes people with Parkinson's disease from 36 sites in 24 countries. 61 RAB GTPases were genetically screened, and candidate variants were genotyped in relatives of the probands to assess disease segregation by linkage analysis. Genotyping was also done to assess variant frequencies in individuals with idiopathic Parkinson's disease and controls, matched for age and sex, who were also from the Centre for Applied Neurogenetics but unrelated to the probands or each other. All participants were aged 18 years or older. The sequencing and genotyping findings were validated by case-control association analyses using bioinformatic data obtained from publicly available clinicogenomic databases (AMP-PD, GP2, and 100 000 Genomes Project) and a private German clinical diagnostic database (University of Tübingen). Clinical and pathological findings were summarised and haplotypes were determined. In-vitro studies were done to investigate protein interactions and enzyme activities. FINDINGS: Between June 1, 2010, and May 31, 2017, 130 probands from Canada and Tunisia (47 [36%] female and 83 [64%] male; mean age 72·7 years [SD 11·7; range 38-96]; 109 White European ancestry, 18 north African, two east Asian, and one Hispanic] underwent whole-exome sequencing. 15 variants in RAB GTPase genes were identified, of which the RAB32 variant c.213C>G (Ser71Arg) cosegregated with autosomal dominant Parkinson's disease in three families (nine affected individuals; non-parametric linkage Z score=1·95; p=0·03). 2604 unrelated individuals with Parkinson's disease and 344 matched controls were additionally genotyped, and five more people originating from five countries (Canada, Italy, Poland, Turkey, and Tunisia) were identified with the RAB32 variant. From the database searches, in which 6043 individuals with Parkinson's disease and 62 549 controls were included, another eight individuals were identified with the RAB32 variant from four countries (Canada, Germany, UK, and USA). Overall, the association of RAB32 c.213C>G (Ser71Arg) with Parkinson's disease was significant (odds ratio [OR] 13·17, 95% CI 2·15-87·23; p=0·0055; I INTERPRETATION: RAB32 Ser71Arg is a novel genetic risk factor for Parkinson's disease, with reduced penetrance. The variant was found in individuals with Parkinson's disease from multiple ethnic groups, with the same haplotype. In-vitro assays show that RAB32 Arg71 activates LRRK2 kinase, which indicates that genetically distinct causes of familial parkinsonism share the same mechanism. The discovery of RAB32 Ser71Arg also suggests several genetically inherited causes of Parkinson's disease originated to control intracellular immunity. This shared aetiology should be considered in future translational research, while the global epidemiology of RAB32 Ser71Arg needs to be assessed to inform genetic counselling.

A pathogenic variant in RAB32 causes autosomal dominant Parkinson's disease and activates LRRK2 kinase.	BACKGROUND: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder. Mendelian forms have revealed multiple genes, with a notable emphasis on membrane trafficking; RAB GTPases play an important role in PD as a subset are both regulators and substrates of LRRK2 protein kinase. To explore the role of RAB GTPases in PD, we undertook a comprehensive examination of their genetic variability in familial PD. METHODS: Affected probands from 130 multi-incident PD families underwent whole-exome sequencing and genotyping, Potential pathogenic variants in 61 RAB GTPases were genotyped in relatives to assess disease segregation. These variants were also genotyped in a larger case-control series, totaling 3,078 individuals (2,734 with PD). The single most significant finding was subsequently validated within genetic data (6,043 with PD). Clinical and pathologic findings were summarized for gene-identified patients, and haplotypes were constructed. In parallel, wild-type and mutant RAB GTPase structural variation, protein interactions, and resultant enzyme activities were assessed. FINDINGS: We found INTERPRETATION: Our study provides unequivocal evidence to implicate RAB32 Ser71Arg in PD. Functional analysis demonstrates LRRK2 kinase activation. We provide a mechanistic explanation to expand and unify the etiopathogenesis of monogenic PD.

Integrative multi-omics approaches identify molecular pathways and improve Alzheimer's disease risk prediction.	INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder with heterogeneous genetic and molecular underpinnings. Polygenic scores (PGS) capture little of this complexity. METHODS: We conducted genome-, transcriptome-, and proteome-wide association studies (G/T/PWAS) on 15,480 individuals from the Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project R4 (ADSP) to identify AD-associated signals, followed by pathway enrichment analysis. Integrative risk models (IRMs) were developed using genetically regulated components of gene and protein expression and clinical covariates. Elastic-net logistic regression and random forest classifiers were evaluated using standard metrics and compared against baseline PGS. RESULTS: Known and novel signals were identified via G/T/PWAS. Enrichment analyses highlighted cholesterol and immune signaling pathways. The best-performing IRM, random forest with transcriptomic and covariate features, achieved area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) of 0.703 and area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) of 0.622, significantly outperforming PGS and baseline models. DISCUSSION: Integrating univariate discovery approaches with multivariate modeling enhances AD risk prediction and offers novel insights into underlying biological processes. HIGHLIGHTS: Identified novel contributions to Alzheimer's disease (AD) from a multi-omics perspective. Integrated genome-wide association studies (GWAS), transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS), and proteome-wide association studies (PWAS) in a unified association study framework. Developed a method for predicting heritable risk of late-onset AD. Demonstrated that ancestry-aware modeling improves AD risk prediction accuracy.

Genetic variation in the Nr1d1 transcription factor binding site shapes metabolism-related protein networks associated with cognitive resilience in an Alzheimer's disease mouse reference panel.	INTRODUCTION: Our previous work established the AD-BXD mouse panel as an innovative model for studying the genetic complexity and heterogeneity underlying Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this study, we leveraged this model and proteomics approach to identify protein signatures linked to cognitive resilience in AD. METHODS: We assessed cognitive performance in 6-month-old AD-BXD mice using contextual fear conditioning and calculated a quantitative resilience score. Frontal cortex proteomes were analyzed using data-independent acquisition mass spectrometry. Protein quantitative trait loci (pQTL) mapping and transcription factor motif analysis were performed. RESULTS: Cognitive resilience was highly heritable. Of nine pQTL proteins associated with resilience, eight mapped to a shared locus on chromosome 1, forming a genetically regulated module. This module mediates the link between specific SNPs and cognitive outcomes in AD. DISCUSSION: These findings reveal a protein network underlying resilience to early AD pathology, with Nr1d1 emerging as a key transcriptional regulator. HIGHLIGHTS: Quantitative proteomics analysis using the genetically diverse AD-BXD mouse panel identified nine proteins whose abundances are under genetic control and associated with differences in cognitive response to early-onset AD mutations. Genetic mapping revealed that the abundances of eight of these nine proteins are regulated by the same genomic region on chromosome 1, forming a module that mediates the relationship between specific SNPs and cognitive outcomes in response to AD mutations. Integrating proteomic and genomic data suggests that SNP rs46128598, located in the transcription factor binding site of nuclear receptor subfamily 1 group D member 1 (Nr1d1), is a novel effector of metabolic pathways involved in cognitive performance differences in AD mutant carriers. This study indicates that targeting the molecular drivers of genetic resilience to AD mutations, including Nr1d1-mediated proteins (Ak1a1, Gars1, Nudt3, Ogdh, Ptpn11, Iars2, Uba1, Ppt1, and Tmem223), could lead to new therapeutic approaches to delay the onset and/or progression of AD.

Uncertainty-aware genomic classification of Alzheimer's disease: a transformer-based ensemble approach with Monte Carlo dropout.	Alzheimer's disease (AD) has complex genetic factors that make accurate prediction from genomic data challenging. Current methods lack confidence estimates for their predictions. Our objective is to develop and evaluate an uncertainty-aware deep learning framework for AD prediction that can identify which predictions are reliable. We developed Transformer-based, Uncertainty-aware, Ensemble Network (TrUE-Net), a deep learning framework that combines transformer and random forest models to predict AD from whole-genome sequencing data. The key innovation is using Monte Carlo Dropout to estimate prediction confidence, allowing the model to identify cases where it is uncertain. We analyzed 1050 individuals (607 AD, 443 controls) from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative cohort. On 525 test samples, accuracy of TrUE-Net without uncertainty threshold was 65.1% with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 0.664. Using uncertainty thresholds, the model classified 75.4% of samples (n = 396) as 'uncertain' and 24.6% (n = 129) as 'certain'. The uncertain group showed accuracy of 62.6% and F1 of 0.584, while the certain group showed accuracy of 72.9% and F1 of 0.821. Uncertainty quantification through Monte Carlo Dropout provides a framework for assessing prediction reliability in genomic AD classification, potentially allowing more informed interpretation of model outputs.

Genome-wide association studies of TDP-43 proteinopathy and hippocampal sclerosis reveal shared genetic associations with APOE and TMEM106B.	INTRODUCTION: Transactive response DNA binding protein 43 kDa (TDP-43) proteinopathy has been linked to cognitive decline and often co-occurs with hippocampal sclerosis (HS). To identify genetic markers of TDP-43 proteinopathy and HS, we performed genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of HS and TDP-43 inclusions. METHODS: Genetic data were obtained through the Alzheimer Disease Genetics Consortium and collaborating sites (HS: N = 9509; TDP-43: N = 4669). Statistical analyses included association analysis with HS and TDP-43 inclusions and meta-analysis, a mediation analysis, and fine mapping of the transmembrane protein 106B (TMEM106B) region. RESULTS: Two regions achieved genome-wide significance with TDP-43: apolipoprotein E (APOE) and TMEM106B. Three loci reached genome-wide significance with HS: APOE, TMEM106B, and granulin precursor (GRN). Fine mapping of TMEM106B identified 93 variants in the credible set. Mediation analyses showed that genetic effects on HS were partially mediated through TDP-43 proteinopathy. DISCUSSION: We identified associations with TDP-43 inclusion and HS, showing shared genetic risk across frontotemporal lobar degeneration, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, and limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy. HIGHLIGHTS: HS and TDP-43 contribute to dementia and often co-occur. The etiology and relationship of HS and TDP-43 remains unclear. HS and TDP-43 share genetic risk factors in the genes APOE and TMEM106B. Genes have direct effects on HS, with additional effects mediated through TDP-43.

Genome-wide pleiotropy analysis of longitudinal blood pressure and harmonized cognitive performance measures.	INTRODUCTION: Identifying pleiotropy for blood pressure (BP) and cognitive performance measures may indicate mechanistic links between hypertension and Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHODS: We performed a pleiotropy genome-wide association study (GWAS) for paired measures of systolic, diastolic, pulse, and mean arterial pressure with memory, executive function, and language scores using 116,075 exam data from 25,726 participants in clinic-based and prospective cohorts. Significant findings were evaluated by Bayesian colocalization and differential gene expression in brain tissue from pathologically confirmed AD cases with and without clinical symptoms. RESULTS: Genome-wide significant pleiotropy for BP and cognitive performance with JPH2, GATA3, PAX2, LOC105371656, and SUFU in the total sample; RTN4, ULK2, SORBS2, and LOC100128993 in prospective cohorts; and ADAMTS3 and LINC02946 in clinic-based cohorts. Six pleiotropic loci influence cognition directly, and six genes were differentially expressed between pathologically confirmed AD cases with and without antemortem cognitive impairment. DISCUSSION: Our results provide insight into mechanisms underlying hypertension and AD. HIGHLIGHTS: Genome-wide significant pleiotropy in blood pressure (BP) and cognitive performance measures were identified with 11 novel loci: JPH2, GATA3, PAX2, LOC105371656, SUFU in the total sample; RTN4, ULK2, SORBS2, LOC100128993 in prospective cohorts; and ADAMTS3, LINC02946 in clinic-based cohorts. SUFU, RTN4, SORBS2, ADAMTS3, and GATA3 affected cognition directly rather than through BP. ACTR1A, HIF1AN, ADAMTS3, RTN4, SORBS2, and SUFU at pleiotropic loci were differentially expressed among controls and pathologically confirmed AD cases with and without clinical symptoms.

Examining the Performance of Polygenic Risk Scores for Alzheimer Disease Within and Across Populations Using	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Alzheimer disease (AD) has a complex etiology with a strong genetic component. Despite mounting evidence that genetic risk effect sizes vary by population, most research on the genetics of AD has examined only data sets of individuals with European ancestry. In this study, we investigate the variable performance and transferability of polygenic risk scores (PRSs) by deriving a PRS from analyses of AD for various race and ethnic categories and applying this across groups using a METHODS: After quality control and application of inclusion criteria, we analyzed 11,254 individuals from the Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project Release 3 with 3 predominant self-identified race/ethnicity groups: Hispanic individuals (n = 2,207), non-Hispanic Black individuals (n = 2,437), and non-Hispanic White individuals (n = 6,610). For each group, a 5-fold cross-validation approach was used to perform a genome-wide association study (training) and construct PRS estimates (test). This approach allowed for consideration of within-group and across-group PRS performance. Area under the curve (AUC) was calculated for each race/ethnicity-specific PRS within each cross-validation fold. Various PRS criteria were considered, including rare single-nucleotide polymorphisms and the RESULTS: Across all participant groups, the PRS trained in the same race/ethnicity category as the test group nearly exclusively outperformed the other PRSs with considerable benefit in the Hispanic group. The range of AUCs across iterations was also greater when applying PRSs from other groups. These findings were consistent after inclusion of DISCUSSION: In this study, we demonstrated the variable performance of AD PRSs within race/ethnicity groups and the weakness in transferability across groups, accounting for different criteria in PRS calculation. This work provided a framework for improving PRS application for AD and highlighted the importance of recruiting diverse populations in genetic studies.

Increased availability of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) has facilitated the study of rare variants (RVs) in complex diseases. Multiple RV association tests are available to study the relationship between genotype and phenotype, but most do not fully leverage the availability of variant-level functional annotations. We propose genome-wide rare variant enrichment evaluation (gruyere), an empirical Bayesian framework that complements existing methods by learning global, trait-specific weights for functional annotations to improve variant prioritization. We apply gruyere to WGS data from the Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project to identify Alzheimer disease (AD)-associated genes and annotations. Growing evidence suggests that the disruption of microglial regulation is a key contributor to AD risk, yet existing methods have not examined rare non-coding effects that incorporate such cell-type-specific information. To address this gap, we (1) define per-gene non-coding RV test sets using predicted enhancer and promoter regions in microglia and other brain cell types (oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, and neurons) and (2) include cell-type-specific variant effect predictions (VEPs) as functional annotations. gruyere identifies 13 significant genetic associations not detected by other RV methods, four of which remain significant in omnibus tests. We find that deep-learning-based VEPs for splicing, transcription factor binding, and chromatin state are highly predictive of functional non-coding RVs. Our study establishes a robust framework incorporating functional annotations, coding RVs, and cell-type-associated non-coding RVs to perform genome-wide association tests, uncovering AD-relevant genes and annotations.

ABCA7 deletion lowers age at onset of Alzheimer's disease and interacts with APOE ε4 synergistically in African-ancestry populations.	INTRODUCTION: Apolipoprotein E (APOE) and ABCA7 genes are among the strongest heritable risk factors for Alzheimer's disease (AD) in African-ancestry (AA) populations. APOE 𝜀4 affects both risk and age at onset (AAO), with lower risk in AA populations. This study evaluates the independent and interactive effects of the AA-specific ABCA7 frameshift deletion and APOE 𝜀4 allele on AAO. METHODS: We analyzed 3510 AA individuals, including AD cases and controls. Cox regression models assessed the effects of ABCA7 deletion, APOE genotypes, and their interactive influence on AAO. RESULTS: APOE ε3/ε4 carriers with the ABCA7 deletion had a significantly shorter survival compared to ε3/ε4 carriers without the deletion. No significant differences were found between deletion carriers and non-carriers with APOE ε3/ε3 or ε4/ε4 genotypes. DISCUSSION: Our study showed that the ABCA7 deletion lowered the AAO of AD in APOE ε3/ε4 carriers from AA populations. These findings suggest that the AA-specific ABCA7 deletion and the APOE ε4 allele have synergistic effects on AAO. HIGHLIGHTS: AA-specific ABCA7 deletion lowers AAO of AD in APOE ε3/ε4 carriers from AA populations. Findings suggest an interaction between ABCA7 deletion and APOE ε4 on AAO. APOE ε4 has a strong, dose-dependent effect on AAO of AD in AA individuals. ABCA7 deletion impact on AAO of AD is stronger in females with APOE ε3/ε4.

Developing biobanking processes for Alzheimer's disease and related dementia research in Africa: Experience from the Recruitment and Retention for Alzheimer's Disease Diversity in the Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project (READD-ADSP).	The Recruitment and Retention for Alzheimer's Disease Diversity in the Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project (READD-ADSP) aims to recruit 5000 African participants (Alzheimer's disease [AD] and cognitively unimpaired controls) to generate genomic and biomarker data to better characterize AD neurobiology in Africa from countries that constitute the African Dementia Consortium (AfDC). Blood samples from study participants are separated into fractions and transported to the African Coordinating Centre (ACC: Ibadan, Nigeria), where DNA extraction and long-term biospecimen storage are carried out. Plasma and DNA aliquots are shipped to the John P. Hussman Institute for Human Genomics, University of Miami (HIHG-UM, Miami, USA) for genotyping, whole genome sequencing, and biomarker analysis. Innovative solutions were devised to mitigate challenges encountered so far. Our biobanking experience in a low-resource setting demonstrates the feasibility of establishing a successful African biobanking network, as an important infrastructure to support Alzheimer's disease and related dementias research in Africa. HIGHLIGHTS: Biobanking is gaining grounds in Africa in studies related to neurological disorders. The Recruitment and Retention for Alzheimer's Disease Diversity in the Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project (READD-ADSP) biobanking network is a new initiative to enhance infrastructure for Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) research in Africa through the African Dementia Consortium. The processes of the stepwise creation and development of the READD-ADSP biobanking network have been guided by global best practices and regulatory standards. Challenges were encountered in the process of establishing the READD-ADSP biobank, and home-grown solutions were developed to mitigate the challenges. The READD-ADSP biobanking experience offers lessons to researchers in low-resource settings on how collaborative efforts between the global north and global south enhance cutting-edge team science to tackle ageing-associated brain disorders in low- and middle-income countries.

The role of community advisory boards in enhancing recruitment and retention in Alzheimer's disease and related dementia research in Africa: Experience from the READD-ADSP study.	INTRODUCTION: The Recruitment and Retention of Alzheimer's Disease Diversity Genetic Cohorts in the Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project (READD-ADSP) was established to bridge the gap in Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) research in Africa. We examined the role of Community Advisory Boards (CABs) in improving participant recruitment and retention in ADRD research in Africa, by exploring how culturally sensitive engagement, community trust-building, and stakeholder involvement influence research participation. METHODS: A multi-site, multi-phased qualitative study approach that involved establishment of CABs, initial planning meetings and community engagement cum recruitment activities. RESULTS: Twenty-one CABs (141 members) were established across 14 study sites in 9 African Dementia Consortium (AfDC) member countries. Co-creation planning meetings, culturally sensitive outreaches for brain health, dementia awareness creation, and recruitment were held. DISCUSSION: Establishing CABs within the READD-ADSP project has proven instrumental in co-creating culturally appropriate and community-centered strategies for recruitment and retention in ADRD research in Africa. HIGHLIGHTS: The Recruitment and Retention of Alzheimer's Disease Diversity Genetic Cohorts in the Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project (READD-ADSP) project utilizes a community-engaged research (CER) framework to develop a community engagement program and establish Community Advisory Boards (CABs) to enhance participant recruitment and retention. There is a need to standardize CER practices and promote context-sensitive and culturally appropriate CE activities across African Dementia Consortium (AfDC) sites to ensure cultural sensitivity and enhance recruitment and retention. The project seeks to empower CABs to promote national dementia policies by collaborating with policy-makers and advancing equitable dementia scienced and care in Africa.

The dynamics of cognitive decline toward Alzheimer's disease progression: Results from ADSP-PHC's harmonized cognitive composites.	INTRODUCTION: Accurately assessing the temporal order of cognitive decline across multiple domains is critical in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Existing literature presents controversial conclusions likely due to the use of a single cohort and different analytical strategies. METHODS: Harmonized composite cognitive measures in memory, language, and executive functions from 13 cohorts in the Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project Phenotype Harmonization Consortium (ADSP-PHC) were used. A double anchoring events-based sigmoidal mixed model was developed using time to incident AD diagnosis as the time scale. RESULTS: In general, decline in memory occurred before decline in language, followed by decline in executive function. This temporal order generally persisted within each subgroup of apolipoprotein E ε4 carrier status, sex, and race/ethnicity. DISCUSSION: This study demonstrated the use of harmonized data across multiple cohorts to characterize the temporal order of cognitive decline along AD progression. Using time to incident AD diagnosis as the time scale can enhance research reproducibility and clinical practice. HIGHLIGHTS: Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project Phenotype Harmonization Consortium's harmonized composite cognitive measures from 13 cohort studies fitted with a novel double anchoring event-based sigmoidal mixed model reveal the following temporal order of cognitive decline toward AD progression: memory, language, and executive function. If only investigated using individual cohort studies, the temporal order of cognitive decline would vary due to the underlying heterogeneities across studies. This temporal order generally persisted within each subgroup of apolipoprotein E ε4 carrier status, sex, and race/ethnicity.

Structural variation detection and association analysis of whole-genome-sequence data from 16,543 Alzheimer's disease sequencing project subjects.	INTRODUCTION: The role of structural variations (SVs) in Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains understudied. METHODS: We analyzed whole-genome sequencing data from the Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project (N = 16,543) and identified 400,234 (168,223 high-quality) SVs. Laboratory validation yielded a sensitivity of 82% (85% for high-quality). RESULTS: We found a burden of singletons (odds ratio [OR] = 1.07, p = 0.0017) and homozygous deletions (OR = 1.14, p < 0.0001) in cases. On AD genes, we observed the ultra-rare SVs associated with the disease, including protein-altering SVs in ABCA7, APP, PLCG2, and SORL1. Twenty-one SVs are in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with known AD-risk variants, exemplified by a 5k deletion in LD (R DISCUSSION: This study highlights the pivotal role of SVs in AD genetics. HIGHLIGHTS: Observed a significant burden of singletons and homozygous deletions in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. Identified rare protein-altering structural variations (SVs) in ABCA7, APP, PLCG2, and SORL1. Established linkages between SVs and AD risk-associated single nucleotide variants (SNVs). Discovered a novel deletion near RNA5SP293 linked to AD, replicated independently. Uncovered over-representation of SVs in neuronal function pathways.

White Matter Abnormalities and Cognition in Aging and Alzheimer Disease.	IMPORTANCE: There has yet to be a large-scale study quantifying the association between white matter microstructure and cognitive performance and decline in aging and Alzheimer disease (AD). OBJECTIVE: To investigate the associations between tract-specific white matter microstructure and cognitive performance and decline in aging and AD-related cognitive impairment. DESIGN SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: This prognostic study of aging and AD, a secondary data analysis of multisite cohort studies, acquired data from 9 cohorts between September 2002 and November 2022. Participants were eligible if they had diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) data, domain-specific cognitive composite EXPOSURES: White matter microstructure and cognitive performance and decline. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Clinical diagnosis, imaging measures (dMRI, T1-weighted MRI, and amyloid and tau positron emission tomography), and cognitive tests. RESULTS: Of 4467 participants who underwent 9208 longitudinal cognitive sessions, 2698 (60.4%) were female, and the mean age (SD) was 74.3 (9.2) years; 3213 were cognitively unimpaired, 972 had mild cognitive impairment, and 282 had AD dementia. White matter free water (FW) showed the strongest associations with cross-sectional cognitive performance and longitudinal cognitive decline across all domains, particularly memory. FW in limbic tracts, such as the cingulum, presented the strongest associations with both memory performance (cingulum: β = -0.718; CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: White matter microstructural changes, particularly FW, play a critical role in cognitive decline in aging and AD-related cognitive impairment. These findings highlight the importance of FW correction in dMRI studies and highlight the limbic system, especially the cingulum and fornix, as key regions associated with cognitive decline; the interaction models highlight that integrating FW-corrected metrics with other AD biomarkers may further elucidate the biological mechanisms of neurodegeneration in aging.

Integrative multi-omics approaches identify molecular pathways and improve Alzheimer's Disease risk prediction.	Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is the most prevalent condition that impacts the aging population, with no effective treatment or singular underlying causal factor identified. As a complex disease, characterizing the genetic risk of developing AD has proven to be difficult; polygenic scores (PGS) exclusively use common variants which fail to fully capture disease heterogeneity. This study used univariate and multivariate approaches to characterize AD risk. Genome-, transcriptome-, and proteome-wide association studies (GWAS, TWAS, and PWAS) were conducted on 15,480 individuals from the Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP) R4 release to identify AD-associated signals, followed by pathway enrichment analysis. Integrative risk models (IRMs) were developed using genetically-regulated components of gene and protein expression and clinical covariates. Elastic-net logistic regression and random forest classifiers were evaluated using area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC), area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC), F1-score, and balanced accuracy. These IRMs were compared against baseline PGS and covariate models. We identified 104 genomic, 319 transcriptomic, and 17 proteomic associations with AD under significant thresholds. Putatively novel associations were enriched in signaling, myeloid differentiation, and immune pathways. The best-performing IRM, random forest with transcriptomic and covariate features, achieved an AUROC of 0.703 and AUPRC of 0.622, significantly outperforming PGS and baseline models. Integrating univariate discovery approaches with multivariate modeling enhances AD risk prediction and offers insights into underlying biological processes.

In a sample of 89 Dominican families from the National Institute on Aging's Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP), where at least one family member had a confirmed Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis, we conducted an exploratory recessive whole-genome sequencing (WGS) analysis using family-based association testing (FBAT-GEE). This method tests jointly for affection status and age-at-onset under a recessive inheritance mode. Our analysis identified a genome-wide significant association for rs847697 in the PDK2 gene on chromosome 17, near the MAPT gene previously implicated in AD through linkage studies.

Recent studies have studied CHIP mutations in individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD), but it is unclear whether their role in AD pathogenesis is protective, detrimental, or neutral. In this study, we used molecular-barcoded deep gene panel sequencing (∼400X) to examine CHIP mutations in 298 blood samples from AD and neurotypical individuals 60 years and older. The AD patients exhibited a significantly higher burden of CHIP mutations compared to the age-matched controls (p < 2e-7, odds ratio (OR) = 2.89), particularly in low-frequency variants often not captured by standard whole exome or whole genome sequencing (WGS).

Whole Genome Variable Number Tandem Repeat Analysis in Alzheimer Disease.	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Investigation into different allelic variants may yield new associative genes to predict late-onset Alzheimer disease (LOAD). Variable number tandem repeats (VNTRs) are important polymorphic components of the genome; however, they have been previously overlooked because of their complex genotyping. New software can now determine differing lengths of VNTRs; however, this has not been tested in a large case-control population. METHODS: We used VNTRseek to genotype over 200,000 tandem repeats in 9,501 cases and controls from the Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project. We first identified limiting factors of this analysis and then examined the association of VNTRs with AD diagnosis in a subset of non-Hispanic White participants. RESULTS: We found that VNTRs were highly associated with areas of the genome with a high number of previously identified variants. From our case-control analysis, we identified 9 VNTRs with a repeat allele length associated with LOAD including VNTRs on DSC3, NR2E3, CCNY, PKP4, GRAP, and MAP6. DISCUSSION: We were able to show the feasibility of this new type of analysis in large-scale whole-genome sequencing data and identify promising VNTRs that are associated with LOAD.

The Dynamics of Cognitive Decline towards Alzheimer's Disease Progression: Results from ADSP-PHC's Harmonized Cognitive Composites.	INTRODUCTION: Accurately assessing temporal order of cognitive decline across multiple domains is critical in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Existing literature presented controversial conclusions likely due to the use of a single cohort and different analytical strategies. METHODS: Harmonized composite cognitive measures in memory, language and executive functions from 13 cohorts in the ADSP-PHC data are used. A novel double anchoring events-based sigmoidal mixed model was developed using time to the incident of AD diagnosis as the time scale. RESULTS: Decline in memory occurred before decline in language which was followed by the decline in executive function. Throughout the entire AD continuum, APOE- DISCUSSION: Using harmonized data across multiple cohorts is the key to accurately characterizing the temporal order of AD biomarkers.

LD-informed deep learning for Alzheimer's gene loci detection using WGS data.	INTRODUCTION: The exponential growth of genomic datasets necessitates advanced analytical tools to effectively identify genetic loci from large-scale high throughput sequencing data. This study presents Deep-Block, a multi-stage deep learning framework that incorporates biological knowledge into its AI architecture to identify genetic regions as significantly associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). The framework employs a three-stage approach: (1) genome segmentation based on linkage disequilibrium (LD) patterns, (2) selection of relevant LD blocks using sparse attention mechanisms, and (3) application of TabNet and Random Forest algorithms to quantify single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) feature importance, thereby identifying genetic factors contributing to AD risk. METHODS: The Deep-Block was applied to a large-scale whole genome sequencing (WGS) dataset from the Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP), comprising 7416 non-Hispanic white (NHW) participants (3150 cognitively normal older adults (CN), 4266 AD). RESULTS: 30,218 LD blocks were identified and then ranked based on their relevance with Alzheimer's disease. Subsequently, the Deep-Block identified novel SNPs within the top 1500 LD blocks and confirmed previously known variants, including DISCUSSION: The Deep-Block framework effectively processes large-scale high throughput sequencing data while preserving SNP interactions during dimensionality reduction, minimizing bias and information loss. The framework's findings are supported by tissue-specific eQTL evidence across brain regions, indicating the functional relevance of the identified variants. Additionally, the Deep-Block approach has identified both known and novel genetic variants, enhancing our understanding of the genetic architecture and demonstrating its potential for application in large-scale sequencing studies. HIGHLIGHTS: Growing genomic datasets require advanced tools to identify genetic loci in sequencing.Deep-Block, a novel AI framework, was used to process large-scale ADSP WGS data.Deep-Block identified both known and novel AD-associated genetic loci.rs429358 (	Alzheimer's disease; deep learning; genetic loci; imputation methods; linkage disequilibrium; whole‐genome sequencing

Sex and APOE ε4 allele differences in longitudinal white matter microstructure in multiple cohorts of aging and Alzheimer's disease.	INTRODUCTION: The effects of sex and apolipoprotein E (APOE)-Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk factors-on white matter microstructure are not well characterized. METHODS: Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging data from nine well-established longitudinal cohorts of aging were free water (FW)-corrected and harmonized. This dataset included 4741 participants (age = 73.06 ± 9.75) with 9671 imaging sessions over time. FW and FW-corrected fractional anisotropy (FA RESULTS: Sex differences in FA DISCUSSION: There are prominent differences in white matter microstructure by sex and APOE ε4 carrier status. This work adds to our understanding of disparities in AD. Additional work to understand the etiology of these differences is warranted. HIGHLIGHTS: Sex and apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 carrier status relate to white matter microstructural integrity. Females generally have lower free water-corrected fractional anisotropy compared to males. APOE ε4 carriers tended to have higher free water than non-carriers.

Copy number variants (CNVs) are DNA gains or losses involving >50 base pairs. Assessing CNV effects on disease risk requires consideration of several factors. First, there are no natural definitions for CNV loci. Second, CNV effects can depend on dosage and length. Third, CNV effects can be more accurately estimated when all CNV events in a genomic region are analyzed together to assess their joint effects. We propose a new framework for association analysis that directly models an individual's entire CNV profile within a genomic region. This framework represents an individual's CNVs using a CNV profile curve to capture variations in CNV length and dosage and to bypass the need to predefine CNV loci. CNV effects are estimated at each genome position, making the results comparable across different studies. To jointly estimate the effects of all CNVs, we use a Lasso penalty to select CNVs associated with the trait and integrate a weighted L2-fusion penalty to encourage similar effects of adjacent CNVs when supported by the data. Simulations show that the proposed model can more effectively identify causal CNVs while maintaining false positive rates comparable to baseline methods and yield more precise effect-size estimates across different settings. When applied to CNV derived from whole genome sequencing data of the Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project, the proposed methods identify additional CNVs associated with Alzheimer's Disease (AD). These identified CNVs overlap with several known AD-risk genes and are significantly enriched by biological processes related to neuron structures and functions crucial in AD development.

Biobank-scale characterization of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias identifies potential disease-causing variants, risk factors, and genetic modifiers across diverse ancestries.	Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (AD/ADRDs) pose a significant global public health challenge, underscored by the intricate interplay of genetic and environmental factors that differ across ancestries. To effectively implement equitable, personalized therapeutic interventions on a global scale, it is essential to identify disease-causing mutations and genetic risk and resilience factors across diverse ancestral backgrounds. Exploring genetic-phenotypic correlations across the globe enhances the generalizability of research findings, contributing to a more inclusive and universal understanding of disease. This study leveraged biobank-scale data to conduct the largest multi-ancestry whole-genome sequencing characterization of AD/ADRDs. We aimed to build a valuable catalog of potential disease-causing, genetic risk and resilience variants impacting the etiology of these conditions. We thoroughly characterized genetic variants from key genes associated with AD/ADRDs across 11 genetic ancestries, utilizing data from All of Us, UK Biobank, 100,000 Genomes Project, Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project, and the Accelerating Medicines Partnership in Parkinson's Disease, including a total of 25,001 cases and 93,542 controls. We prioritized 116 variants possibly linked to disease, including 18 known pathogenic and 98 novel variants. We detected previously described disease-causing variants among controls, leading us to question their pathogenicity. Notably, we showed a higher frequency of	100,000 Genomes Project; ADSP; AMP PD; All of Us; Alzheimer’s disease; UK Biobank; clinical trials; dementia; disease-causing variants; disease-modifying variants; genetic risk factors; genetics; protective variants; target prioritization

Blood-derived mitochondrial DNA copy number is associated with Alzheimer disease, Alzheimer-related biomarkers and serum metabolites.	BACKGROUND: Blood-derived mitochondrial DNA copy number (mtDNA-CN) is a proxy measurement of mitochondrial function in the peripheral and central systems. Abnormal mtDNA-CN not only indicates impaired mtDNA replication and transcription machinery but also dysregulated biological processes such as energy and lipid metabolism. However, the relationship between mtDNA-CN and Alzheimer disease (AD) is unclear. METHODS: We performed two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) using publicly available summary statistics from GWAS for mtDNA-CN and AD to investigate the causal relationship between mtDNA-CN and AD. We estimated mtDNA-CN using whole-genome sequence data from blood and brain samples of 13,799 individuals from the Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project. Linear and Cox proportional hazards models adjusting for age, sex, and study phase were used to assess the association of mtDNA-CN with AD. The association of AD biomarkers and serum metabolites with mtDNA-CN in blood was evaluated in Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative using linear regression. We conducted a causal mediation analysis to test the natural indirect effects of mtDNA-CN change on AD risk through the significantly associated biomarkers and metabolites. RESULTS: MR analysis suggested a causal relationship between decreased blood-derived mtDNA-CN and increased risk of AD (OR = 0.68; P = 0.013). Survival analysis showed that decreased mtDNA-CN was significantly associated with higher risk of conversion from mild cognitive impairment to AD (HR = 0.80; P = 0.002). We also identified significant associations of mtDNA-CN with brain FDG-PET (β = 0.103; P = 0.022), amyloid-PET (β = 0.117; P = 0.034), CSF amyloid-β (Aβ) 42/40 (β=-0.124; P = 0.017), CSF t-Tau (β = 0.128; P = 0.015), p-Tau (β = 0.140; P = 0.008), and plasma NFL (β=-0.124; P = 0.004) in females. Several lipid species, amino acids, biogenic amines in serum were also significantly associated with mtDNA-CN. Causal mediation analyses showed that about a third of the effect of mtDNA-CN on AD risk was mediated by plasma NFL (P = 0.009), and this effect was more significant in females (P < 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicates that mtDNA-CN measured in blood is predictive of AD and is associated with AD biomarkers including plasma NFL particularly in females. Further, we illustrate that decreased mtDNA-CN possibly increases AD risk through dysregulation of mitochondrial lipid metabolism and inflammation.

Association of common and rare variants with Alzheimer's disease in more than 13,000 diverse individuals with whole-genome sequencing from the Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project.	INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common disorder of the elderly that is both highly heritable and genetically heterogeneous. METHODS: We investigated the association of AD with both common variants and aggregates of rare coding and non-coding variants in 13,371 individuals of diverse ancestry with whole genome sequencing (WGS) data. RESULTS: Pooled-population analyses of all individuals identified genetic variants at apolipoprotein E (APOE) and BIN1 associated with AD (p < 5 × 10 DISCUSSION: We observed that complementary pooled-population and subgroup-specific analyses offered unique insights into the genetic architecture of AD. HIGHLIGHTS: We determine the association of genetic variants with Alzheimer's disease (AD) using 13,371 individuals of diverse ancestry with whole genome sequencing (WGS) data. We identified genetic variants at apolipoprotein E (APOE), BIN1, PSEN1, and LINC00320 associated with AD. We observed rare non-coding variants in the promoter of TOMM40 distinct of APOE.

LD-informed deep learning for Alzheimer's gene loci detection using WGS data.	INTRODUCTION: The exponential growth of genomic datasets necessitates advanced analytical tools to effectively identify genetic loci from large-scale high throughput sequencing data. This study presents Deep-Block, a multi-stage deep learning framework that incorporates biological knowledge into its AI architecture to identify genetic regions as significantly associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). The framework employs a three-stage approach: (1) genome segmentation based on linkage disequilibrium (LD) patterns, (2) selection of relevant LD blocks using sparse attention mechanisms, and (3) application of TabNet and Random Forest algorithms to quantify single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) feature importance, thereby identifying genetic factors contributing to AD risk. METHODS: The Deep-Block was applied to a large-scale whole genome sequencing (WGS) dataset from the Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP), comprising 7,416 non-Hispanic white participants (3,150 cognitively normal older adults (CN), 4,266 AD). RESULTS: 30,218 LD blocks were identified and then ranked based on their relevance with Alzheimer's disease. Subsequently, the Deep-Block identified novel SNPs within the top 1,500 LD blocks and confirmed previously known variants, including DISCUSSION: The Deep-Block framework effectively processes large-scale high throughput sequencing data while preserving SNP interactions during dimensionality reduction, minimizing bias and information loss. The framework's findings are supported by tissue-specific eQTL evidence across brain regions, indicating the functional relevance of the identified variants. Additionally, the Deep-Block approach has identified both known and novel genetic variants, enhancing our understanding of the genetic architecture and demonstrating its potential for application in large-scale sequencing studies.

Role of the X Chromosome in Alzheimer Disease Genetics.	IMPORTANCE: The X chromosome has remained enigmatic in Alzheimer disease (AD), yet it makes up 5% of the genome and carries a high proportion of genes expressed in the brain, making it particularly appealing as a potential source of unexplored genetic variation in AD. OBJECTIVES: To perform the first large-scale X chromosome-wide association study (XWAS) of AD. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This was a meta-analysis of genetic association studies in case-control, family-based, population-based, and longitudinal AD-related cohorts from the US Alzheimer's Disease Genetics Consortium, the Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project, the UK Biobank, the Finnish health registry, and the US Million Veterans Program. Risk of AD was evaluated through case-control logistic regression analyses. Data were analyzed between January 2023 and March 2024. Genetic data available from high-density single-nucleotide variant microarrays and whole-genome sequencing and summary statistics for multitissue expression and protein quantitative trait loci available from published studies were included, enabling follow-up genetic colocalization analyses. A total of 1 629 863 eligible participants were selected from referred and volunteer samples, 477 596 of whom were excluded for analysis exclusion criteria. The number of participants who declined to participate in original studies was not available. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURES: Risk of AD, reported as odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs. Associations were considered at X chromosome-wide (P < 1 × 10-5) and genome-wide (P < 5 × 10-8) significance. Primary analyses are nonstratified, while secondary analyses evaluate sex-stratified effects. RESULTS: Analyses included 1 152 284 participants of non-Hispanic White, European ancestry (664 403 [57.7%] female and 487 881 [42.3%] male), including 138 558 individuals with AD. Six independent genetic loci passed X chromosome-wide significance, with 4 showing support for links between the genetic signal for AD and expression of nearby genes in brain and nonbrain tissues. One of these 4 loci passed conservative genome-wide significance, with its lead variant centered on an intron of SLC9A7 (OR, 1.03; 95% CI, 1.02-1.04) and colocalization analyses prioritizing both the SLC9A7 and nearby CHST7 genes. Of these 6 loci, 4 displayed evidence for escape from X chromosome inactivation with regard to AD risk. CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: This large-scale XWAS of AD identified the novel SLC9A7 locus. SLC9A7 regulates pH homeostasis in Golgi secretory compartments and is anticipated to have downstream effects on amyloid β accumulation. Overall, this study advances our knowledge of AD genetics and may provide novel biological drug targets. The results further provide initial insights into elucidating the role of the X chromosome in sex-based differences in AD.

Disentangling the genetic underpinnings of neuropsychiatric symptoms in Alzheimer's disease in the Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project: Study design and methodology.	INTRODUCTION: Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) are highly prevalent in Alzheimer's disease (AD). There are no effective treatments targeting these symptoms. METHODS: To facilitate identification of causative mechanistic pathways, we initiated an effort (NIH: U01AG079850) to collate, harmonize, and analyze all available NPS data (≈ 100,000 samples) of diverse ancestries with whole-genome sequencing data from the Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP). RESULTS: This study will generate a genomic resource for Alzheimer's disease with both harmonized whole-genome sequencing and NPS phenotype data that will be publicly available through NIAGADS. Primary analyses will (1) identify novel genetic risk factors associated with NPS in AD, (2) characterize the shared genetic architecture of NPS in AD and primary psychiatric disorders, and (3) assess the role of ancestry effects in the etiology of NPS in AD. DISCUSSION: Expansion of the ADSP to harmonize and refine NPS phenotypes coupled with the proposed core analyses will lay the foundation to disentangle the molecular mechanisms underlying these detrimental symptoms in AD in diverse populations. HIGHLIGHTS: Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) are highly prevalent in Alzheimer's disease (AD).There are no effective treatments targeting NPS in AD.The current effort aims to collate, harmonize, and analyze all NPS data from the Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project.Core analyses will identify underlying genetic factors and mechanistic pathways.The harmonized genomic and phenotypic data from this initiative will be available through National Institute on Aging Genetics of Alzheimer's Disease Data Storage Site.

A Specialized Reference Panel with Structural Variants Integration for Improving Genotype Imputation in Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD).	We developed an imputation panel for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias (ADRD) using whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data from the Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP). Recognizing the significant associations between structural variants (SVs) and AD, and their underrepresentation in existing public reference panels, our panel uniquely integrates single nucleotide variants (SNVs), short insertions and deletions (indels), and SVs. This panel enhances the imputation of disease susceptibility, including rare AD-associated SNVs, indels, and SVs, onto genotype array data, offering a cost-effective alternative to whole-genome sequencing while significantly augmenting statistical power. Notably, we discovered 10 rare indels nominal significant related to AD that are absent in the TOPMed-r2 panel and identified three suggestive significant (p-value < 1E-05) AD-associated SVs in the genes EXOC3L2 and DMPK, were identified. These findings provide new insights into AD genetics and underscore the critical role of imputation panels in advancing our understanding of complex diseases like ADRD.

MitoH3: Mitochondrial Haplogroup and Homoplasmic/Heteroplasmic Variant Calling Pipeline for Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project.	BACKGROUND: Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is a double-stranded circular DNA and has multiple copies in each cell. Excess heteroplasmy, the coexistence of distinct variants in copies of mtDNA within a cell, may lead to mitochondrial impairments. Accurate determination of heteroplasmy in whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data has posed a significant challenge because mitochondria carrying heteroplasmic variants cannot be distinguished during library preparation. Moreover, sequencing errors, contamination, and nuclear mtDNA segments can reduce the accuracy of heteroplasmic variant calling. OBJECTIVE: To efficiently and accurately call mtDNA homoplasmic and heteroplasmic variants from the large-scale WGS data generated from the Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP), and test their association with Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHODS: In this study, we present MitoH3-a comprehensive computational pipeline for calling mtDNA homoplasmic and heteroplasmic variants and inferring haplogroups in the ADSP WGS data. We first applied MitoH3 to 45 technical replicates from 6 subjects to define a threshold for detecting heteroplasmic variants. Then using the threshold of 5% ≤variant allele fraction≤95%, we further applied MitoH3 to call heteroplasmic variants from a total of 16,113 DNA samples with 6,742 samples from cognitively normal controls and 6,183 from AD cases. RESULTS: This pipeline is available through the Singularity container engine. For 4,311 heteroplasmic variants identified from 16,113 samples, no significant variant count difference was observed between AD cases and controls. CONCLUSIONS: Our streamlined pipeline, MitoH3, enables computationally efficient and accurate analysis of a large number of samples.

The 2022 symposium on dementia and brain aging in low- and middle-income countries: Highlights on research, diagnosis, care, and impact.	Two of every three persons living with dementia reside in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). The projected increase in global dementia rates is expected to affect LMICs disproportionately. However, the majority of global dementia care costs occur in high-income countries (HICs), with dementia research predominantly focusing on HICs. This imbalance necessitates LMIC-focused research to ensure that characterization of dementia accurately reflects the involvement and specificities of diverse populations. Development of effective preventive, diagnostic, and therapeutic approaches for dementia in LMICs requires targeted, personalized, and harmonized efforts. Our article represents timely discussions at the 2022 Symposium on Dementia and Brain Aging in LMICs that identified the foremost opportunities to advance dementia research, differential diagnosis, use of neuropsychometric tools, awareness, and treatment options. We highlight key topics discussed at the meeting and provide future recommendations to foster a more equitable landscape for dementia prevention, diagnosis, care, policy, and management in LMICs. HIGHLIGHTS: Two-thirds of persons with dementia live in LMICs, yet research and costs are skewed toward HICs. LMICs expect dementia prevalence to more than double, accompanied by socioeconomic disparities. The 2022 Symposium on Dementia in LMICs addressed advances in research, diagnosis, prevention, and policy. The Nairobi Declaration urges global action to enhance dementia outcomes in LMICs.

On the effect heterogeneity of established disease susceptibility loci for Alzheimer's disease across different genetic ancestries.	INTRODUCTION: Genome-wide association studies have identified numerous disease susceptibility loci (DSLs) for Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, only a limited number of studies have investigated the dependence of the genetic effect size of established DSLs on genetic ancestry. METHODS: We utilized the whole genome sequencing data from the Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP) including 35,569 participants. A total of 25,459 subjects in four distinct populations (African ancestry, non-Hispanic White, admixed Hispanic, and Asian) were analyzed. RESULTS: We found that nine DSLs showed significant heterogeneity across populations. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs2075650 in translocase of outer mitochondrial membrane 40 (TOMM40) showed the largest heterogeneity (Cochran's Q = 0.00, I DISCUSSION: We observed substantial heterogeneity for the APOE-harboring 19q13.32 region with TOMM40/APOE/APOC1 genes. The largest risk effect was seen among African Americans, while Asians showed a surprisingly small risk effect.

Key variants via the Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project whole genome sequence data.	INTRODUCTION: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified loci associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) but did not identify specific causal genes or variants within those loci. Analysis of whole genome sequence (WGS) data, which interrogates the entire genome and captures rare variations, may identify causal variants within GWAS loci. METHODS: We performed single common variant association analysis and rare variant aggregate analyses in the pooled population (N cases = 2184, N controls = 2383) and targeted analyses in subpopulations using WGS data from the Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP). The analyses were restricted to variants within 100 kb of 83 previously identified GWAS lead variants. RESULTS: Seventeen variants were significantly associated with AD within five genomic regions implicating the genes OARD1/NFYA/TREML1, JAZF1, FERMT2, and SLC24A4. KAT8 was implicated by both single variant and rare variant aggregate analyses. DISCUSSION: This study demonstrates the utility of leveraging WGS to gain insights into AD loci identified via GWAS.

Association of Structural Forms of 17q21.31 with the Risk of Progressive Supranuclear Palsy and	IMPORTANCE: The chromosome 17q21.31 region, containing a 900 Kb inversion that defines H1 and H2 haplotypes, represents the strongest genetic risk locus in progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). In addition to H1 and H2, various structural forms of 17q21.31, characterized by the copy number of α, β, and γ duplications, have been identified. However, the specific effect of each structural form on the risk of PSP has never been evaluated in a large cohort study. OBJECTIVE: To assess the association of different structural forms of 17q.21.31, defined by the copy numbers of α, β, and γ duplications, with the risk of PSP and DESIGN SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Utilizing whole genome sequencing data of 1,684 (1,386 autopsy confirmed) individuals with PSP and 2,392 control subjects, a case-control study was conducted to investigate the association of copy numbers of α, β, and γ duplications and structural forms of 17q21.31 with the risk of PSP. All study subjects were selected from the Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP) Umbrella NG00067.v7. Data were analyzed between March 2022 and November 2023. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The main outcomes were the risk (odds ratios [ORs]) for PSP with 95% CIs. Risks for PSP were evaluated by logistic regression models. RESULTS: The copy numbers of α and β were associated with the risk of PSP only due to their correlation with H1 and H2, while the copy number of γ was independently associated with the increased risk of PSP. Each additional duplication of γ was associated with 1.10 (95% CI, 1.04-1.17; CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study revealed that the copy number of γ was associated with the risk of PSP independently from H1 and H2. The H1 haplotype with more γ duplications showed a higher odds ratio for PSP and were associated with	17q21.31; Copy number variation (CNV); H1 and H2 haplotypes; MAPT; Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP)

A comparative study of structural variant calling in WGS from Alzheimer's disease families.	Detecting structural variants (SVs) in whole-genome sequencing poses significant challenges. We present a protocol for variant calling, merging, genotyping, sensitivity analysis, and laboratory validation for generating a high-quality SV call set in whole-genome sequencing from the Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project comprising 578 individuals from 111 families. Employing two complementary pipelines, Scalpel and Parliament, for SV/indel calling, we assessed sensitivity through sample replicates (N = 9) with in silico variant spike-ins. We developed a novel metric, D-score, to evaluate caller specificity for deletions. The accuracy of deletions was evaluated by Sanger sequencing. We generated a high-quality call set of 152,301 deletions of diverse sizes. Sanger sequencing validated 114 of 146 detected deletions (78.1%). Scalpel excelled in accuracy for deletions ≤100 bp, whereas Parliament was optimal for deletions >900 bp. Overall, 83.0% and 72.5% of calls by Scalpel and Parliament were validated, respectively, including all 11 deletions called by both Parliament and Scalpel between 101 and 900 bp. Our flexible protocol successfully generated a high-quality deletion call set and a truth set of Sanger sequencing-validated deletions with precise breakpoints spanning 1-17,000 bp.

Human whole-exome genotype data for Alzheimer's disease.	The heterogeneity of the whole-exome sequencing (WES) data generation methods present a challenge to a joint analysis. Here we present a bioinformatics strategy for joint-calling 20,504 WES samples collected across nine studies and sequenced using ten capture kits in fourteen sequencing centers in the Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project. The joint-genotype called variant-called format (VCF) file contains only positions within the union of capture kits. The VCF was then processed specifically to account for the batch effects arising from the use of different capture kits from different studies. We identified 8.2 million autosomal variants. 96.82% of the variants are high-quality, and are located in 28,579 Ensembl transcripts. 41% of the variants are intronic and 1.8% of the variants are with CADD > 30, indicating they are of high predicted pathogenicity. Here we show our new strategy can generate high-quality data from processing these diversely generated WES samples. The improved ability to combine data sequenced in different batches benefits the whole genomics research community.

Report of the APOE4 National Institute on Aging/Alzheimer Disease Sequencing Project Consortium Working Group: Reducing APOE4 in Carriers is a Therapeutic Goal for Alzheimer's Disease.	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder and one of the leading causes of disability worldwide. The apolipoprotein E4 gene (APOE4) is the strongest genetic risk factor for AD. In 2023, the APOE4 National Institute on Aging/Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project working group came together to gather data and discuss the question of whether to reduce or increase APOE4 as a therapeutic intervention for AD. It was the unanimous consensus that cumulative data from multiple studies in humans and animal models support that lowering APOE4 should be a target for therapeutic approaches for APOE4 carriers.

Longitudinal change in memory performance as a strong endophenotype for Alzheimer's disease.	INTRODUCTION: Although large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been conducted on AD, few have been conducted on continuous measures of memory performance and memory decline. METHODS: We conducted a cross-ancestry GWAS on memory performance (in 27,633 participants) and memory decline (in 22,365 participants; 129,201 observations) by leveraging harmonized cognitive data from four aging cohorts. RESULTS: We found high heritability for two ancestry backgrounds. Further, we found a novel ancestry locus for memory decline on chromosome 4 (rs6848524) and three loci in the non-Hispanic Black ancestry group for memory performance on chromosomes 2 (rs111471504), 7 (rs4142249), and 15 (rs74381744). In our gene-level analysis, we found novel genes for memory decline on chromosomes 1 (SLC25A44), 11 (BSX), and 15 (DPP8). Memory performance and memory decline shared genetic architecture with AD-related traits, neuropsychiatric traits, and autoimmune traits. DISCUSSION: We discovered several novel loci, genes, and genetic correlations associated with late-life memory performance and decline. HIGHLIGHTS: Late-life memory has high heritability that is similar across ancestries. We discovered four novel variants associated with late-life memory. We identified four novel genes associated with late-life memory. Late-life memory shares genetic architecture with psychiatric/autoimmune traits.	Alzheimer's disease; GWAS; genetics; memory

Sex-specific genetic architecture of late-life memory performance.	BACKGROUND: Women demonstrate a memory advantage when cognitively healthy yet lose this advantage to men in Alzheimer's disease. However, the genetic underpinnings of this sex difference in memory performance remain unclear. METHODS: We conducted the largest sex-aware genetic study on late-life memory to date (N RESULTS: We identified three sex-specific loci (rs67099044-CBLN2, rs719070-SCHIP1/IQCJ-SCHIP), including an X-chromosome locus (rs5935633-EGL6/TCEANC/OFD1), that associated with memory. Additionally, we identified heparan sulfate signaling as a sex-specific pathway and found sex-specific genetic correlations between memory and cardiovascular, immune, and education traits. DISCUSSION: This study showed memory is highly and comparably heritable across sexes, as well as highlighted novel sex-specific genes, pathways, and genetic correlations that related to late-life memory. HIGHLIGHTS: Demonstrated the heritable component of late-life memory is similar across sexes. Identified two genetic loci with a sex-interaction with baseline memory. Identified an X-chromosome locus associated with memory decline in females. Highlighted sex-specific candidate genes and pathways associated with memory. Revealed sex-specific shared genetic architecture between memory and complex traits.	Alzheimer's disease; GWAS; Genomics; aging; cognition; endophenotypes; memory; sex differences; sex-specific

BACKGROUND: Prior studies using the ADSP data examined variants within presenilin-2 (PSEN2), presenilin-1 (PSEN1), and amyloid precursor protein (APP) genes. However, previously-reported clinically-relevant variants and other predicted damaging missense (DM) variants have not been characterized in a newer release of the Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP). OBJECTIVE: To characterize previously-reported clinically-relevant variants and DM variants in PSEN2, PSEN1, APP within the participants from the ADSP. METHODS: We identified rare variants (MAF <1%) previously-reported in PSEN2, PSEN1, and APP in the available ADSP sample of 14,641 individuals with whole genome sequencing and 16,849 individuals with whole exome sequencing available for research-use (Ntotal = 31,490). We additionally curated variants in these three genes from ClinVar, OMIM, and Alzforum and report carriers of variants in clinical databases as well as predicted DM variants in these genes. RESULTS: We detected 31 previously-reported clinically-relevant variants with alternate alleles observed within the ADSP: 4 variants in PSEN2, 25 in PSEN1, and 2 in APP. The overall variant carrier rate for the 31 clinically-relevant variants in the ADSP was 0.3%. We observed that 79.5% of the variant carriers were cases compared to 3.9% were controls. In those with AD, the mean age of onset of AD among carriers of these clinically-relevant variants was 19.6 ± 1.4 years earlier compared with noncarriers (p-value=7.8×10-57). CONCLUSION: A small proportion of individuals in the ADSP are carriers of a previously-reported clinically-relevant variant allele for AD and these participants have significantly earlier age of AD onset compared to noncarriers.

Genetic analyses in multiplex families confirms chromosome 5q35 as a risk locus for Alzheimer's Disease in individuals of African Ancestry.	There is a paucity of genetic studies of Alzheimer Disease (AD) in individuals of African Ancestry, despite evidence suggesting increased risk of AD in the African American (AA) population. We performed whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and multipoint linkage analyses in 51 multi-generational AA AD families ascertained through the Research in African American Alzheimer Disease Initiative (REAAADI) and the National Institute on Aging Late Onset Alzheimer's disease (NIA-LOAD) Family Based Study. Variants were prioritized on minor allele frequency (<0.01), functional potential of coding and noncoding variants, co-segregation with AD and presence in multi-ancestry ADSP release 3 WGS data. We identified a significant linkage signal on chromosome 5q35 (HLOD=3.3) driven by nine families. Haplotype segregation analysis in the family with highest LOD score identified a 3'UTR variant in INSYN2B with the most functional evidence. Four other linked AA families harbor within-family shared variants located in INSYN2B's promoter or enhancer regions. This AA family-based finding shows the importance of diversifying population-level genetic data to better understand the genetic determinants of AD on a global scale.

NIAGADS Alzheimer's GenomicsDB: A resource for exploring Alzheimer's disease genetic and genomic knowledge.	INTRODUCTION: The National Institute on Aging Genetics of Alzheimer's Disease Data Storage Site Alzheimer's Genomics Database (GenomicsDB) is a public knowledge base of Alzheimer's disease (AD) genetic datasets and genomic annotations. METHODS: GenomicsDB uses a custom systems architecture to adopt and enforce rigorous standards that facilitate harmonization of AD-relevant genome-wide association study summary statistics datasets with functional annotations, including over 230 million annotated variants from the AD Sequencing Project. RESULTS: GenomicsDB generates interactive reports compiled from the harmonized datasets and annotations. These reports contextualize AD-risk associations in a broader functional genomic setting and summarize them in the context of functionally annotated genes and variants. DISCUSSION: Created to make AD-genetics knowledge more accessible to AD researchers, the GenomicsDB is designed to guide users unfamiliar with genetic data in not only exploring but also interpreting this ever-growing volume of data. Scalable and interoperable with other genomics resources using data technology standards, the GenomicsDB can serve as a central hub for research and data analysis on AD and related dementias. HIGHLIGHTS: The National Institute on Aging Genetics of Alzheimer's Disease Data Storage Site (NIAGADS) offers to the public a unique, disease-centric collection of AD-relevant GWAS summary statistics datasets. Interpreting these data is challenging and requires significant bioinformatics expertise to standardize datasets and harmonize them with functional annotations on genome-wide scales. The NIAGADS Alzheimer's GenomicsDB helps overcome these challenges by providing a user-friendly public knowledge base for AD-relevant genetics that shares harmonized, annotated summary statistics datasets from the NIAGADS repository in an interpretable, easily searchable format.

Overestimated prediction using polygenic prediction derived from summary statistics.	BACKGROUND: When polygenic risk score (PRS) is derived from summary statistics, independence between discovery and test sets cannot be monitored. We compared two types of PRS studies derived from raw genetic data (denoted as rPRS) and the summary statistics for IGAP (sPRS). RESULTS: Two variables with the high heritability in UK Biobank, hypertension, and height, are used to derive an exemplary scale effect of PRS. sPRS without APOE is derived from International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project (IGAP), which records ΔAUC and ΔR CONCLUSION: Considering the high heritability of hypertension and height of UK Biobank and sample size of UK Biobank, sPRS results from AD databases are inflated. Independence between discovery and test sets is a well-known basic requirement for PRS studies. However, a lot of PRS studies cannot follow such requirements because of impossible direct comparisons when using summary statistics. Thus, for sPRS, potential duplications should be carefully considered within the same ethnic group.	Alzheimer’s disease; Complex genetic disease; Overestimation bias; Polygenic risk score

Key variants via Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project whole genome sequence data.	INTRODUCTION: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified loci associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) but did not identify specific causal genes or variants within those loci. Analysis of whole genome sequence (WGS) data, which interrogates the entire genome and captures rare variations, may identify causal variants within GWAS loci. METHODS: We performed single common variant association analysis and rare variant aggregate analyses in the pooled population (N cases=2,184, N controls=2,383) and targeted analyses in sub-populations using WGS data from the Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP). The analyses were restricted to variants within 100 kb of 83 previously identified GWAS lead variants. RESULTS: Seventeen variants were significantly associated with AD within five genomic regions implicating the genes OARD1/NFYA/TREML1, JAZF1, FERMT2, and SLC24A4. KAT8 was implicated by both single variant and rare variant aggregate analyses. DISCUSSION: This study demonstrates the utility of leveraging WGS to gain insights into AD loci identified via GWAS.

NOTCH3 C201R variant causes cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) that can be confused with early-onset Alzheimer's disease.	BACKGROUND: NOTCH3 is the causative gene for autosomal dominant cerebral arteriopathy with subcortical infarctions and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) which is associated with both stroke and dementia. When CADASIL presents primarily as dementia it can be difficult to distinguish from Alzheimer's disease (AD) at both the clinical and neuropathological levels. METHODS: We performed exome sequencing of several affected individuals from a large family affected with AD. PCR amplification and direct Sanger sequencing were used to verify variants detected by exome analysis and to screen family members at-risk to carry those variants. Neuropathologic brain evaluation by immunohistochemistry and MRI were performed for the carriers of the NOTCH3 variant. RESULTS: In a three-generation family with AD, we found a c.601 T > C p.Cys201Arg variant in the NOTCH3 gene that caused clinical and neuropathological manifestations of CADASIL. These features included earlier onset of dementia accompanied by behavioral abnormalities in the father and son and white matter abnormalities in the asymptomatic grandson. The family is one branch of a large pedigree studied by the Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP). As part of the ADSP linkage analysis and whole genome sequencing endeavor, an ABCA1 variant, p.Ala937Val, was previously found associated with AD in this pedigree. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings, together with other reported pathogenic missense variants of the C201 codon in NOTCH3, support the role of cysteine 201 as a mutation hotspot for CADASIL and highlight the genetic complexity both clinically and pathologically of AD and related dementia.

DNA from multiple viral species is associated with Alzheimer's disease risk.	INTRODUCTION: Multiple infectious agents, including viruses, bacteria, fungi, and protozoa, have been linked to Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk by independent lines of evidence. We explored this association by comparing the frequencies of viral species identified in a large sample of AD cases and controls. METHODS: DNA sequence reads that did not align to the human genome in sequences were mapped to viral reference sequences, quantified, and then were tested for association with AD in whole exome sequences (WES) and whole genome sequences (WGS) datasets. RESULTS: Several viruses were significant predictors of AD according to the machine learning classifiers. Subsequent regression analyses showed that herpes simplex type 1 (HSV-1) (odds ratio [OR] = 3.71, p = 8.03 × 10-4) and human papillomavirus 71 (HPV-71; OR = 3.56, p = 0.02), were significantly associated with AD after Bonferroni correction. The phylogenetic-related cluster of Herpesviridae was significantly associated with AD in several strata of the data (p < 0.01). DISCUSSION: Our results support the hypothesis that viral infection, especially HSV-1, is associated with AD risk.

Associations of Sex, Race, and Apolipoprotein E Alleles With Multiple Domains of Cognition Among Older Adults.	IMPORTANCE: Sex differences are established in associations between apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 and cognitive impairment in Alzheimer disease (AD). However, it is unclear whether sex-specific cognitive consequences of APOE are consistent across races and extend to the APOE ε2 allele. OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether sex and race modify APOE ε4 and ε2 associations with cognition. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This genetic association study included longitudinal cognitive data from 4 AD and cognitive aging cohorts. Participants were older than 60 years and self-identified as non-Hispanic White or non-Hispanic Black (hereafter, White and Black). Data were previously collected across multiple US locations from 1994 to 2018. Secondary analyses began December 2021 and ended September 2022. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Harmonized composite scores for memory, executive function, and language were generated using psychometric approaches. Linear regression assessed interactions between APOE ε4 or APOE ε2 and sex on baseline cognitive scores, while linear mixed-effect models assessed interactions on cognitive trajectories. The intersectional effect of race was modeled using an APOE × sex × race interaction term, assessing whether APOE × sex interactions differed by race. Models were adjusted for age at baseline and corrected for multiple comparisons. RESULTS: Of 32 427 participants who met inclusion criteria, there were 19 007 females (59%), 4453 Black individuals (14%), and 27 974 White individuals (86%); the mean (SD) age at baseline was 74 years (7.9). At baseline, 6048 individuals (19%) had AD, 4398 (14%) were APOE ε2 carriers, and 12 538 (38%) were APOE ε4 carriers. Participants missing APOE status were excluded (n = 9266). For APOE ε4, a robust sex interaction was observed on baseline memory (β = -0.071, SE = 0.014; P = 9.6 × 10-7), whereby the APOE ε4 negative effect was stronger in females compared with males and did not significantly differ among races. Contrastingly, despite the large sample size, no APOE ε2 × sex interactions on cognition were observed among all participants. When testing for intersectional effects of sex, APOE ε2, and race, an interaction was revealed on baseline executive function among individuals who were cognitively unimpaired (β = -0.165, SE = 0.066; P = .01), whereby the APOE ε2 protective effect was female-specific among White individuals but male-specific among Black individuals. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this study, while race did not modify sex differences in APOE ε4, the APOE ε2 protective effect could vary by race and sex. Although female sex enhanced ε4-associated risk, there was no comparable sex difference in ε2, suggesting biological pathways underlying ε4-associated risk are distinct from ε2 and likely intersect with age-related changes in sex biology.

The Early-Onset Alzheimer's Disease Whole-Genome Sequencing Project: Study design and methodology.	INTRODUCTION: Sequencing efforts to identify genetic variants and pathways underlying Alzheimer's disease (AD) have largely focused on late-onset AD although early-onset AD (EOAD), accounting for ∼10% of cases, is largely unexplained by known mutations, resulting in a lack of understanding of its molecular etiology. METHODS: Whole-genome sequencing and harmonization of clinical, neuropathological, and biomarker data of over 5000 EOAD cases of diverse ancestries. RESULTS: A publicly available genomics resource for EOAD with extensive harmonized phenotypes. Primary analysis will (1) identify novel EOAD risk loci and druggable targets; (2) assess local-ancestry effects; (3) create EOAD prediction models; and (4) assess genetic overlap with cardiovascular and other traits. DISCUSSION: This novel resource complements over 50,000 control and late-onset AD samples generated through the Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP). The harmonized EOAD/ADSP joint call will be available through upcoming ADSP data releases and will allow for additional analyses across the full onset range. HIGHLIGHTS: Sequencing efforts to identify genetic variants and pathways underlying Alzheimer's disease (AD) have largely focused on late-onset AD although early-onset AD (EOAD), accounting for ∼10% of cases, is largely unexplained by known mutations. This results in a significant lack of understanding of the molecular etiology of this devastating form of the disease. The Early-Onset Alzheimer's Disease Whole-genome Sequencing Project is a collaborative initiative to generate a large-scale genomics resource for early-onset Alzheimer's disease with extensive harmonized phenotype data. Primary analyses are designed to (1) identify novel EOAD risk and protective loci and druggable targets; (2) assess local-ancestry effects; (3) create EOAD prediction models; and (4) assess genetic overlap with cardiovascular and other traits. The harmonized genomic and phenotypic data from this initiative will be available through NIAGADS.

Admixture mapping identifies novel Alzheimer's disease risk regions in African Americans.	BACKGROUND: This study used admixture mapping to prioritize the genetic regions associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) in African American (AA) individuals, followed by ancestry-aware regression analysis to fine-map the prioritized regions. METHODS: We analyzed 10,271 individuals from 17 different AA datasets. We performed admixture mapping and meta-analyzed the results. We then used regression analysis, adjusting for local ancestry main effects and interactions with genotype, to refine the regions identified from admixture mapping. Finally, we leveraged in silico annotation and differential gene expression data to prioritize AD-related variants and genes. RESULTS: Admixture mapping identified two genome-wide significant loci on chromosomes 17p13.2 (p = 2.2 × 10 DISCUSSION: Our ancestry-aware regression approach showed that AA individuals have a lower risk of AD if they inherited African ancestry admixture block at the 17p13.2 locus. HIGHLIGHTS: We identified two genome-wide significant admixture mapping signals: on chromosomes 17p13.2 and 18q21.33, which are novel in African American (AA) populations. Our ancestry-aware regression approach showed that AA individuals have a lower risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) if they inherited African ancestry admixture block at the 17p13.2 locus. We found that the overall proportion of African ancestry does not differ between the cases and controls that suggest African genetic ancestry alone is not likely to explain the AD prevalence difference between AA and non-Hispanic White populations.

Progranulin mutations in clinical and neuropathological Alzheimer's disease.	INTRODUCTION: Progranulin (GRN) mutations occur in frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and in Alzheimer's disease (AD), often with TDP-43 pathology. METHODS: We determined the frequency of rs5848 and rare, pathogenic GRN mutations in two autopsy and one family cohort. We compared Braak stage, β-amyloid load, hyperphosphorylated tau (PHFtau) tangle density and TDP-43 pathology in GRN carriers and non-carriers. RESULTS: Pathogenic GRN mutations were more frequent in all cohorts compared to the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD), but there was no evidence for association with AD. Pathogenic GRN carriers had significantly higher PHFtau tangle density adjusting for age, sex and APOE ε4 genotype. AD patients with rs5848 had higher frequencies of hippocampal sclerosis and TDP-43 deposits. Twenty-two rare, pathogenic GRN variants were observed in the family cohort. DISCUSSION: GRN mutations in clinical and neuropathological AD increase the burden of tau-related brain pathology but show no specific association with β-amyloid load or AD.
